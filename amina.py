text = """SYMMETRY IN BIOLOGY
Symmetry is the balance distribution of duplicate body parts of shapes within the body of an organism. Symmetry is the quality of being made up of similar parts facing each other or around an axis. The shape size and relative location on one side of a dividing line mirrors the shape, size and relative location on the other side. Body plans of most multicellular organisms exhibits some form of symmetry whether radial, bilateral or spherical.
TISSUE ORGANIZATION
Tissue organization refers to the process through which tissue undergo extensive remodeling to reach their finally morphology and physiological activity. Again, tissue level of organization refers to the organisms in which the most complex level of organization is the tissue level, that is they have structures where many cells aggregate in a common basement material and functions as a single unit.
BODY CAVITY
A body cavity is a space created in an organism which houses organs and structures. It is lined with a layer of cells and its filled with fluid to protect the organs from damage as the organisms moves around. Body cavity forms during development as solid masses of tissues fold inward of themselves. Creating pockets in which the organs develops. Humans have four body cavities: the dorsal cavity the encloses the brain and spinal cord, the thoracic cavity the encloses the heart and lungs, the abdominal cavity that encloses the most of the digestive organs and kidney. The abdominal cavity is where the majority of the body’s organs lie. These are sometimes referred to the “viscera”, and the pelvic cavity which holds the reproductive organs, bladder, and allow the intestine passage to the anus. The cranial cavity forms part of the body cavity. Cushions and protects the brain within a rigid skull
EMBRYONIC DIVISION
Embryonic division is a division of cells in the early embryo. Initially, the zygote split along a longitudinal plane. The second division is also longitudinal but at 90 degrees to the plane of the first. The third division is perpendicular to the first two and its equatorial in position. These early divisions produce separate cells called blastomeres. The blastomeres forms a compact mass called the morula. the process of embryonic division ends with the formation of blastula(and embryo at the early stage of development when it is a hollow ball of cells.
