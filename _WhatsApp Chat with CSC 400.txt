*NEW YEAR RESOLUTION ( VOL. ONE )*
 [ By: Eugene Ray ]

Habakkuk 2:2 *Then the Lord answered me and said: “Write the vision and make it plain on tablets, that he may run who reads it*.

One of the best decision you can take this year is deciding to write a new year resolution. A new year resolution can be likened as your vision for the year.

 Some of us don't really value writing it but to be sincere to us, writing it will do us more good. How do you vision your spiritual life this year? How many times do you want to fast a week?

 What is the duration you want to spend on God's word and prayer? How often do you want to go for evangelism? How many Christian literatures do you want to read a month? How committed do you want to be in your church? 

What is your vision for this year pertaining to work, education, marriage, relationship, social life and health? These are some of the wonderful questions you can ask yourself today. 

Having asked yourself these questions, you have to write down the vision. We don't write a vision in our mind, we make it plain to set as a reminder. This is what will make you grow in every aspect of your life. 

We don't only decide to grow, we determine to grow by setting a vision. Unless you want to remain at the level where you are, you need to have a resolution.

| *REFERENCES* |
[ Habakkuk 2:1-4, Proverbs 29:18 ]

Dear God, help me to make the right choices in my years left.

*Sam Jonah Library on Fire?* 🤔

Earlier today rumors were being circulated on various social media platforms claiming that the Sam Jonah Library was ablaze 🔥. Various videos were shared. In these videos, fumes could be seen emanating from the library. This sent members of Lazy Students' Association and Anti-Library Students' Association into wild jubilations 💃🏾👯🏾‍♀ thinking one of the most revered edifices on campus had succumbed to an inferno. 


Filla HQ  is sorry to burst the bubbles of such students 😂. The Sam Jonah Library is in a comfortable lead and is waiting for us all next semester. We can confirm that there was no such incident and that the fumes that could be seen in the videos in circulation was as a result of a fumigation exercise being carried out in the library 😅. (Sam Jonah 1:0 Lazy Students) 😹

To our dear students on vacation, cut down on the vacation atopa gyengyen 🍆🍑💦😩. We have heard a lot of your exploits. Results might be released on 14th February ❤. It's about time we stopped clapping buttcheeks and clapped and prayed for our results. 

Happy New Year from Filla HQ ❤

1/8/20, 9:27 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Well you obviously don't understand what's going on.
If you join the US army, you will be deployed to Iran or Iraq, the US is always fighting wars, even uninvited ones.
Ghana on the other hand is a neutral country and we're not required to support any country in case of a world war. And Iran has no reason to attack as anyway.
So as at this moment, being a Ghanaian citizen is much better than being a US soldier. Might be reaching but, it's better than being a US citizen

Which Europeans?
Muslims in Nigeria haven't started nothing.
The only attacks have been in Kenya and even that the US says it's not related to the killing of the general.

Ofc France is in Europe, so is Turkey though partially.
But they're not going to support US not Iran to fight such an unnecessary war especially at this stage. They will only intervene if one party goes too far, most likely if Iran goes too far.
US has allies but their alliance isn't as it used to be thanks to Trump
1/8/20, 10:28 AM - +233 50 228 8715: Lol how many European countries classify themselves as Muslims
1/8/20, 10:56 AM - +233 54 216 4852: <Media omitted>
1/8/20, 10:59 AM - +233 23 240 3912: I like how you're now reading up on the stuff.
NATO spoke as the the body, like the NATO chief said that or sth.
But Germany said the timing wasn't right, France,China.
They went on to warn iran not to retaliate but rather wait for things to be settled diplomatically. Kinda bs considering their general just got killed
1/8/20, 11:02 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Yeah. That statement from NATO was bs
1/8/20, 11:03 AM - +233 23 240 3912: US usually goes unpunished after doing something hasty, Turkey got sanctioned after bombing parts of Syria, not saying it was right but US wouldn't have been sanctioned
1/8/20, 11:05 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Yeah. It's like they're always treated special or something
1/8/20, 11:06 AM - +233 23 240 3912: The veto countries get away with almost everything
1/8/20, 11:06 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Right. And that's what's triggered Iran to wage war against them
1/8/20, 11:08 AM - +233 23 240 3912: To be fair, Iran isn't holy enough to take the higher moral ground, it also has a lot of blood in it's hands
1/8/20, 11:09 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Yeah. A lot.

1/8/20, 11:37 AM - Seth: Rofff **
1/8/20, 11:48 AM - +233 54 216 4852: They went on to warn dem meaning they support US for doin that....because dey all tink the General is a terrorist..and do tink Iran will let dem solve this diplomatically?....is like sum1 beating u and warning u at de same tym....wont u go and gym and take revenge?😒...
1/8/20, 11:51 AM - +233 23 240 3912: The general was noted as a terrorist by US and some of it's allies, but the allies weren't informed before his assassination and also the timing wasn't right.
And though I agree it won't be fair for Iran to just agree to the diplomatic stuff.
But you preamble is a bit flawed, if someone way outta my league beats me and warns me, ofc I won't go back for revenge I'm just gonna cry 🤷🏽‍♂
1/8/20, 11:52 AM - +233 54 216 4852: And Iranians knws very well dat they cant win against US but they are fytin dem...what do u tink?...B4 a blind man will  tell u i will make u bleed meaning he get a stone for his corner ..u barb...do u tink the Russians are nt happy about wah is going on?.
1/8/20, 11:52 AM - +233 54 216 4852: U give up easily😹😹...
1/8/20, 11:53 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Vietnam won against US on similar instances. Iran thinks it can win, war doesn't have a predictable outcome.
1/8/20, 11:54 AM - +233 23 240 3912: You survive by knowing when it's time to fight and when to sit it out
1/8/20, 11:55 AM - +233 54 216 4852: And do u bullies are cowards?..
1/8/20, 11:56 AM - +233 54 216 4852: Thats why responded this yestee...natin US can so about this.... Now they fear😒

1/8/20, 12:02 PM - +233 23 240 3912: The Vietnam's won.
Iran is developing missiles and they don't use stones to fight
1/8/20, 12:03 PM - +233 23 240 3912: I'm not doubting that, but Iran isn't really without weapons
1/8/20, 12:03 PM - +233 54 216 4852: And im not Iranian..i support US....las Vegas bi ma own😹

1/8/20, 12:11 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Iran can develop nuclear bomb if they want to, they're no longer under the 2015* nuclear agreement. And they started mining Uranium again in 2019. So...not much Trump can do about that
1/8/20, 12:12 PM - +233 54 216 4852: Me no...where adey rydee no dey map inside....sit der..

1/15/20, 5:32 AM - +234 706 827 4218: ☘Please give yourself  2min and read this:-

☘（1）Let’s say it’s 8.15pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job.

☘（2）You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. 

☘（3）Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home.

☘（4）Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ll be able to make it that far.

☘（5）You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself.

☘（6）HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONE?
Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only
about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. 

☘（7）However, these victims can help themselves by coughing
repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. 

A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two
seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until
the heart is felt to be beating normally again.

☘（8）Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing
movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. 

☘（9）Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives!!

☘（10）A cardiologist says If everyone who gets this mail
kindly sends it to 10 people, you can bet that we’ll save at least one life.

☘（11）Rather than sending jokes, please..contribute by forwarding this mail which can save a person’s life….

☘（12）If this message comes around you ……more than once…..please don’t get irritated……U need to be happy that you have many friends who care about you & being reminded of how to tackle….Heart attacks….AGAIN…

I'm reliably informed there'd be only _2 groups for MAT 202._
We missed today's meeting, so I suggest we attend that of tomorrow to make up for the lost period and revert to Mon if it can take us.
Reason that, Tues will be tight for us... we'd run from _10:30am to 4:30pm_ with no break in between.

*Ministry of health’s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus influenza outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There's no cure once you are infected.*
*Its spreading from China to various countries*

*Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*
*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesn’t help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*
*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.*
*The symptoms/ description are*
*1.repeated high fever*
*2.prolonged coughing after fever*
*3.Children are prone*
*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*
*5: highly contagious*🚨

2/7/20, 5:09 AM - Enoch: *Flutter Installation guide*
1. download Android studio
developer.andriod.com/studio
2. Install Git 
git-scm.com/downloads
3. install flutter
flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

Check the system requirements and be sure you have windows power shell 5.0 or newer and Git

Copy the git clone repo code .
Go into your C:\ drive and  create a folder called *src* .
Open the folder, right click and do a git bash here then paste the copied code from the site. If you don't have git use cmd. Wait for the download to finish and  open the new folder *flutter* .
Select flutter console and type *flutter doctor*.
You will see some green thick on flutter and Android studio and some red once provided you do not have vscode and a device... Don't worry.
Select the bin folder and copy the path *C:\src\flutter\bin*.
Navigate to edit environment variables from desktop by searching for it on the windows button in the bottom left corner of the screen. 
Select environment variables from the pop up .
Double click path and paste *C:\src\flutter\bin*.
Then click ok .

You are ready to use flutter doctor command in your normal cmd and you can now enjoy Android studio and flutter. Simple right, contact me if you need further help, I thought you would thou if you follow the above instructions through.
Thank you.🙏🏿

Dear Sweet Girl 

Time and ability plus double capacity has forced my pen to dance automatically on this benedicted sheet of paper. I hope you're swimming in the wonderful pool of Mr. Health there. I am also parambulating in the cool breeze of wellness here.

Sweetie pie, the reason why this miraculous thing is happening is because, honey, I love you spontaneously, and as I stand horizontally parallel to the wall and vertically perpendicular to the ground now, I only think of you, since you are a fantastic and fabulous girl, put together as fantabulous. I implore you to decipher this my anthem of love oozing out from the innermost pendulum of my thoraxial cavity.

Darling, please stop haranguing with the feelings in my heart because I love you more than a snake loves rat.
To me each day I start by dreaming of you. Each time I see you, my metabolism suddenly halts and my peristalsis goes in reverse gear. My medula oblongata also ceases functioning.

Crazy, crazy, crazy you may say but this is verily veritable. If only you knew what is going on in my encephalon, you would prostrate. That's why I need to see you vis a vis soon for a better elucidation through tete a tete. No hyperbole & onomatopoeia, simple candidness.

Only you and me are protagonists in this subtle affair. As I cogitate and ruminate over the last episode, I genuflex before the Omnipotent and implore him to let this affair emulsify.

By the way, I was bamboozled, scintilated, exhilarated, and left in a state of prolonged euphoria by the contents of your missive which was quite edifying and exalting. It left my bio-chemistry in a paradise-like equilibrium.

Empirically speaking, I love u chemically... I don't ever want to see gloom and doom looming over your angelic live portrait. Let my appellation be scribbled across your heart, with indelible ink. If any boy tries to ask for your companionship, tell him that u are leased and caveated.

I think I have to pen off here, because I still haven't finished studying electrolysis polymerization. But before I evaporate, I like to revitalize your memory with those encapsulating lyrics which proclaim that your catarrh is my butter, your piss is my mimbo, the world's greatest lover is me.

Catch you later. Sleep tight and don't let those bed bugs bite you because you are too sweet for me. 

Goodbye for now.

Your Slave in Love, 
Your Pillow, Your Cushion.

2/28/20, 2:04 PM - Enchill: I am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I know the truth about the coronavirus outbreak. It is far worse than the media are telling you.
I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies — or perhaps occupied — a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified information and I have been involved in many top secret government projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.

I have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.

It will not surprise you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would make it easy to identify me.

By now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply "coronavirus". You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal — most likely a bat or a pangolin — that was sold in a wild animal market. You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.

All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.

Let me start by telling you that the world does not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in keeping real power out of the hands of their "ordinary" citizens. To this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in particular have perfected the art of creating made-up "divisions" between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that both serve the same masters.

These same nations also posses technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true workings of the world from the "uninitiated" public.

Just to give you one example, there aren’t actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s, as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.

Let me return to the virus.

Last year, large-scale anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party considered these to be a grave threat to the integrity and stability of the motherland. The U.S. government and the EU both knew that the Chinese were secretly working on a biological agent that was supposed to make the protesters docile and obedient. Without going into detail, I worked on that project. We tried to develop a sort of spray that could be dispersed from helicopters or drones and that would lead to mental retardation and behavioural change.

Naturally, as Hong Kong is one of the most open and international cities in the world, the Party decided that it was too risky to release the agent in Hong Kong without first testing it. For this, it needed a great number of human guinea pigs. Two groups were identified for this.

First, we rounded up a large number of so-called "islamic radicals" in Xinjiang Province and took them to what we called "training camps". We had already been using these camps for human experimentation for several years, but the Hong Kong protests meant that we redoubled our efforts. We exposed the inmates to various "alpha" experimental agents. As these were odourless and invisible, the subjects were not aware that they were taking part in medical trials. The resulting high rates of cancer, premature dementia, suicidal depression and death by organ failure could easily be suppressed, as the camps are located in very remote parts of our motherland.

Once the initial experiments had yielded a "beta" agent, it was transported to Hubei Province, where it was deployed in a special military testing facility outside the city of Wuhan. This was not even a particularly well-kept secret: the existence of this facility has been reported in international news. Even the fact that it is located close to the wild animal market is a known fact.

By then our President had already introduced a "social credit" system that allowed us to identify disloyal, counter-revolutionary and bourgeois elements in our society. Using the social credit scores — which are taken from online activity, electronic shopping behaviour and reports from informers in civil society — we selected some of the worst offenders. These included human rights lawyers and activists, Christians, homosexuals, artists, intellectuals, people who speak foreign languages, and other undesirables.

Once these troublemakers had been collected and placed in the testing facility, we exposed them to the Agent, which is biochemical in nature and spread in an invisible aerosol, akin to certain viruses. Initial results were encouraging, as we saw significant cognitive decline and reduction in higher mental processing facilities. Essentially, our undesirables were becoming mildly mentally disabled, which is precisely the effect we wanted to produce in order to pacify the restive population of Hong Kong.

Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that the Agent also had other effects. About one week after the retardation set in, our subjects developed major anxiety and panic attacks. Eventually they developed symptoms akin to those of paranoid schizophrenics. At that point, their bodies rapidly deteriorated. They developed massive internal bleeding; the walls of their arteries dissolved; they bled out of their eyes and orifices, and their tissue disintegrated.

To put it in a more direct Western manner, they started to melt.

Death usually occurred through multiple organ failure. This was preceded by at least five days of severe agony which could not be alleviated by painkillers. It was at this time that I first violated our protocol: one subject, an elderly lady who had published defamatory cartoons of our President, begged me for death with such insistence that I took pity and shot her. I was reprimanded, but fortunately the complaint was dropped when I agreed to reimburse the cost of the bullet. I swore to myself never again to show such unnecessary emotion.

We decided that our Agent was unusable. It was far too destructive for our purposes. We wanted the population of Hong Kong to submit to us; we did not want to exterminate it.

Naturally, our American friends had by then taken an interest in our work and asked us for a sample for their own research and testing purposes. They hinted that they wished to use it to resolve certain difficulties in Venezuela. Normally we would have agreed, as we maintain friendly relations with the CIA, but given the extremely toxic nature of the Agent, we declined.

This, as it turned out, was a grave mistake. The CIA was convinced that we had developed something very powerful and wanted to keep it to ourselves. They offered a great deal of money to one of our researchers. Foolishly, he agreed to sell them a specimen. We found out just in time for the handover and tried to stop it from happening. In the ensuing shoot-out — don’t bother to look for it in the news, it was never reported anywhere — several dozen people were killed.

More importantly, however, the Agent escaped.

The shoot-out took place at the wild animal market which has been reported as the location of the "animal to human" transmission that started the outbreak. But of course there was no such transmission; it was just the location where the CIA was supposed to receive the sealed vial containing the Agent. The vial shattered when it was dropped by the traitor who had agreed to sell it to the Americans.

By now I understand you will be sceptical. If I really am who I say I am, why would I be sharing this information on the internet? Let me assure you that I am no friend of the Western system of governance. I love my motherland and I am loyal to the Communist Party. It has lifted hundreds of millions of my compatriots out of squalor and poverty. However, I am also a human being and I have a conscience.

Most importantly, I have a wife and a son.

Once we realised that the Agent had escaped and would start to spread, we swiftly put all of Wuhan into lockdown. I was one of those tasked to manage the fallout of the contamination. Of course we could not keep such a huge undertaking secret, so we decided to order our state media to report that a "coronavirus" had broken out in Wuhan.

In reality, of course, there is no "coronavirus". It was all made up.

It was one of my colleagues who came up with the genius idea of pretending that people with the common flu suffered from the coronavirus. This allowed us to hide the true nature of the disease. Let me explain.

It is currently flu season in China. When we realised that we could no longer control the spread of the Agent, we sent our men to all the hospitals and instructed all doctors to diagnose every case of the common flu as "coronavirus". We came up with a new name — 2019-nCoV — and handed out "factsheets" that described a made-up illness.

The result of this decision was that tens of thousands of individuals who were simply suffering from a cold or flu were now diagnosed as having a mysterious coronavirus that, although infectious, was not often lethal. While this frightened the public, it allowed us to push the narrative that the disease was not that deadly; it also gave us time to prepare for the catastrophe that was sure to come by imposing a lockdown on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.

You have not heard this in the news — and given the size of Wuhan, with its population of 11 million, it is not known even to many of the residents — but within days thousands upon thousands were infected and before long they suffered the agonising deaths that I have already described. Within a week, there were so many corpses that we did not know what to do with them, so we ordered the surviving social credit prisoners to drive the bodies into the countryside and bury them in mass graves. But it was very difficult to keep this activity secret, and we could not even keep up as there were so many corpses. We planted a story that five million residents had "fled" Wuhan. In reality, of course, many of those people had died from the Agent.

I was working around the clock helping to orchestrate this cover-up. When I think back to my actions now, I feel great shame. At the time I still believed that I was fighting for my motherland and that the rule of the Party was right and just. But deep down, I had already begun to have doubts.

My faith in the Party was shaken even more deeply when I learnt what had happened to Dr Li Wenliang. He was one of the few doctors who refused falsely to diagnose flu patients with the "coronavirus". As a punishment, he was sent to help transport dead bodies to mass graves. The expectation was that he would be infected with the Agent and die an agonising death, but to our great surprise, he did not contract the illness.

You have of course read that he died of "coronavirus". You have been misinformed. A sergeant of the People’s Armed Police injected him with a mixture of heroin and mercury that caused his lungs to deflate.

When I found out about this I became unsure whether or not I was doing the right thing. While I believe that it is appropriate for a government to rule with a severe hand, I do not think that it was right to kill Dr Li. He was a compassionate and kind man and he cared about his patients; how can our motherland not benefit from having such a doctor?

I shared my concerns with my wife, but she convinced me that I should not say anything to my superiors. She said that it was too dangerous; that they valued loyalty above everything else; and that I would only find trouble if I admitted to my doubts about their practices. She also pointed out that we benefited from priority medical treatment. As senior officials, we received regular supplies of the highly-sophisticated hazmat masks that are the only known technology that can prevent infection. She implored me to think of our son, who is still small. If I spoke out and were caught, our lives would be at risk.

Around the same time, it became clear that the Agent was entirely beyond our control. It was spreading like wildfire throughout Hubei Province and beyond, infecting tens of millions and causing them all to die.

I understand that what I just said is difficult to believe, because you have been told that there have been only about 50,000 infections, and far fewer deaths. But these are the influenza infections that have been falsely passed off as the non-existent "coronavirus". The Agent is far, far more contagious than that, and its fatality rate, unlike the "coronavirus", is not 2%.

No, its fatality rate is 100%. Nobody recovers from it. Everybody who contracts it dies.

And a lot of people are contracting it.

Hubei Province lies in ruins. The various travel restrictions and lockdowns that have been imposed were not created to stop the spread of the Agent — none of them can stop it, not embargoes, not face masks or hand sanitiser — but to stop the survivors from seeing the catastrophe with their own eyes.

I am part of the greatest cover-up in human history: the hiding of the deaths of tens of millions. Very soon, Hubei Province will be no more than a giant mortuary, and the truth will come out.

For me, the turning point came when the Party told yet another lie, and that lie was too dreadful even for me to accept. You may have heard that China built a new hospital, called Huoshenshan Hospital, in Wuhan, in order to provide additional quarantine and isolation facilities for infected patients. You may have heard that they built it in only ten days.

That too is a lie.

Sure, they did build something in six days. But it was not a hospital. The true nature of the building was top secret. Initially, I was naive enough to believe that the Party was demonstrating its compassion and care for the people. But then my superiors sent me to Huoshenshan. I was shown around the installation by a military police officer called Corporal Meng (this is not his real name). It was there that I saw the truth.

As I have mentioned, the only way to protect oneself from the Agent is by wearing a special protective mask that is entirely unlike those available commercially. Even medical professionals do not have access to it. It is available only to biomedical warfare researchers and it contains extremely advanced technology.

These masks need to be kept at a particular temperature to offer full protection, and lose their effectiveness very quickly. As I have also already said, one of the benefits of my position was that both my family and I had access to regular supplies, which is why were safe when compared to civilians, doctors and even lower-level government officials, all of whom wore utterly ineffective surgical masks in the misguided belief that they would protect them.

And so, wearing this special equipment, I went to Huoshenshan with Corporal Meng.

Whatever you want to call that place, it is not a hospital. Sure, the entrance looks like a hospital and in the ward at the front of the complex, there are what appear to be normal medical beds. There, thousands of infected patients lie, all of them in the early stages of the disease. I walked along those long, white corridors next to Corporal Meng, his angular face dispassionate in his military fatigues, and saw hundreds upon hundreds of identical hospital beds on which squirmed the terrified and diseased inhabitants of Wuhan. Their cries and pleas haunt me in the long nights in which I now am unable to sleep.

But this was merely the beginning. Eventually the Corporal took me to the rear of this front section. There, locked metal gates led to what he called the "middle section". The patients in the front are unaware of its existence. It is there that the more advanced cases are kept, in what most closely resembles a mental asylum.

Immediately upon entering this part of Huoshenshan I was struck by the dim lighting and stench of vomit and human waste. Here the unfortunates roamed freely, their minds gradually disintegrating in endless panic attacks and psychotic episodes. Here too there were no more doctors, merely gorilla-faced men in black uniforms who belonged to some secret branch of the military police I had never heard of.

They appeared to have been selected for their cruelty, for they beat and degraded the patients in the most sadistic manner. Many of the inmates had regressed to childlike states and lay on the floor weeping like infants and begging for compassion that they did not receive. There was cruel pleasure in the eyes of these thugs as they brutalised the unfortunates. They beat them with batons, sprayed pepper spray into their eyes and kicked them with their steel-capped boots. As I was from military intelligence, the guards did not even attempt to hide their activities. They even invited me to join; in every way, they treated me as one of them.

Yes, one of them. I stood in the grey staff bathroom of Huoshenshan and looked into a cheap mirror and asked myself — is this really what you are? Are you really like them?

But the violence was not merely an expression of sadism, for the poor inmates were not there to be cared for.

They were there to work.

There was one more set of doors, and beyond them lay what the Corporal called the "Core". And it was there that I saw it — piles and piles of dead bodies, stacked on top of one another all the way to the ceiling. There were men, women and children, elderlies and toddlers, rich and poor, beautiful and misshapen, proud and humble.

They were all of them dead. Our Agent made no distinction between any of them.

I gasped when the Corporal led me to the Core. I cannot count how many there were, but it was many, many thousands. And in the midst of the piles of corpses was a kind of path, and I heard a roaring sound in the distance. The miserable patients from the middle section picked up the dead and carried and dragged them away into the dark, even as the guards beat them with truncheons.

It took me a little while before I grasped what was happening. I simply could not believe what lay at the end of that path in the Core.

It was an enormous furnace, with great fires roaring within.

One by one, their minds destroyed and their bodies twisted, the dying men and women carried the corpses to the furnace and cast them inside in a doomed attempt to hide the dreadful truth. I saw several of them collapse from exhaustion only for their lifeless bodies to be added to the mountains of corpses on both sides. In a seemingly endless line they went, their emaciated bodies clad in grey overalls, their backs bent under the weight of their dreadful cargo. Many howled and groaned in terror and their voices joined in a sorrowful cacophony that lingered over the roar of the fires.

In deep shock, I stared at the boundless horror before me. Beside me stood Corporal Meng, his freshly-shaved face as emotionless as before. When I turned to face him, he looked at me. His mouth smiled, but his eyes did not.

"We use the energy to operate Huoshenshan," he said. "We save the state considerable resources in this way. And look," — he waved at the gallery of the dead — "there are so many of them here. You could almost describe it as renewable energy." He laughed and waved his hand in a strangely camp gesture.

I stood speechless and stared at the infernal scenes before me. Men in black uniforms screamed like daemons at the wretches who were disposing of the corpses for them. They stripped the dead of anything that had value — jewellery, cash, expensive clothing — and tossed these items onto an enormous pile next to the furnace. When I asked the Corporal what would be done with the items, they said that they would be used to pay for the "healthcare expenses" incurred by the patients’ stay in Huoshenshan.

I vomited in the toilet. When I flushed and came out of the stall, Corporal Meng stood by the door and looked at me. His face was as blank as before, but in his eyes I thought I registered a very faint trace of contempt. You are ten years my senior, the look said, but you are soft.

I thanked him for his service and went home.

When I arrived, I saw that I had received hundreds of updates on the encrypted device the Party uses to communicate to insiders. The news were unimaginably grim. The State Legal and Economic Commission had allocated funds for the construction of dozens of facilities like Huoshenshan all throughout China. The Agent had spread not only to every single province of the motherland, but to most other nations in the world. Fortunately, we had agreements in place with other governments — they agreed to pretend that the infections were due to a coronavirus. They were just as worried as we were that a panic might break out in their countries. The Americans in particular were terrified that the S&P 500 might decline. This, they said, would be unacceptable in an election year, so we could count on their full support.

Of course the World Health Organisation also helped us. For a long time, the only issue with the WHO has been that we have been locked in a contest with the Americans about who bribes them more. They released all sorts of sophisticated misinformation about having decoded the DNA of the so-called coronavirus. All this has allowed us to stave off a global panic.

For now.

Yet the situation was worsening with astonishing speed. I am reluctant to reveal too much on this point, as it would make it too easy for my enemies to identify me, but we quickly began to implement measures to protect our most senior leaders. If you look at the world news, you will see that Xi Jinping, our President, disappeared for approximately one week after the outbreak, before being seen again with the leader of Cambodia.

You should know that the person who met the Cambodian leader was not President Xi. It was a body double who had, for many years, been trained to look and sound just like our President. President Xi is of course not careless enough to risk his own death. He is safely ensconced in a secret bunker underneath Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Party in Beijing.

Nor was he the only leader who is in hiding. In fact, I can assure you that over half of all senior Party members are currently being imitated by trained actors who are following instructions given to them via special implants. Do you really think that our Prime Minister would risk his life by going to Wuhan?

All of this means that our government has become utterly paralysed and the functions of the state have been taken over by the military.

It became clear to me that our efforts were pointless. Yes, the lockdowns, travel bans and targeted assassinations of rebellious journalists allowed us to hide the true situation in Wuhan; but I knew that this would not last. Once the mass deaths begin in the rest of the world — in our estimation, this should happen within the next week or so — everyone will know the truth. It will become clear that we cannot protect ourselves from the Agent. Surgical masks, hand sanitiser, gloves — nothing can stop it. Nothing except the special hazmat masks, but those cannot be produced in anything like sufficient quantities. You, an ordinary person, will never even receive one, let alone a sufficient number to see you through the coming holocaust.

For those of you reading this, therefore, all I can suggest is that you keep your loved ones close to you. Hug them, tell them what they mean to you. Enjoy the time you have left with them. It is not typical in Chinese culture to express one’s feelings in this way, but I have learnt the importance of such gestures.

I promised my wife that I would show this document to her before I posted it.

Yet I broke my word.

I hear her weep in loud, hoarse sobs in the bedroom, and the keyboard of my laptop is wet with my own tears. Not long ago, we received results of the regular tests that are part of our "priority medical treatment", and we learnt that my son had been infected with the Agent.

The military police that has supplied me with the special protective mask had been giving expired and ineffective masks to my son, masks that senior officials had already worn and then discarded when they ceased to protect them. My own masks, on the other hand, had always been of the necessary quality.

I suppose they decided that my son was of lower priority than me. I suppose my son could not help them with their cover-up.

We had long ago decided that we would be different — we would be honest with him, always. And so when he asked us, we told him the truth. We told him that he was very sick. He asked more, and we told him he would not get better.

He continued asking, and we told him that he would die. He is very small, but he was old enough to understand.

His terrified wails will haunt me for the rest of my miserable days in this world.

Let them come. Let them do with me as they will. I no longer care.

2/29/20, 8:16 PM - +233 55 105 2663: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Zanjan University Corona virus arrives in any country, sooner or later there is no doubt that many countries have no diagnostic sets or equipment, so please use as much as possible of natural vitamin C to strengthen your immune system.
Don't worry, vitamin C gets rid of it a lot, and it's fine.
Also make sure to use more yellow wood In addition.
The virus currently contains no vaccine and no specific treatment
Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous. This disease appears to be caused by gene fusion in a snake and bat, and it has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.

It is important to keep the message on your greatest knowledge: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Slices of lemon in a cup of lukewarm water can save your life."  *
Even if you work, you should take a look at this message and pass it on to others!  Hot lemon can kill cancer cells!  The lemon cut into three parts and put in a cup, then pour hot water and turn it into (alkaline water), drinking it every day will certainly benefit everyone.  Hot lemons can release the anti-cancer drug again.  Hot lemon juice appeared on cancerous tumors and cured all cancers. Treatment with this extract only destroys malignant cells and does not affect healthy cells.
Second: the acids and carboxylic acid contained in lemon juice can regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.
Professor Chen Horin notes that anyone who receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life...
I have done my job and I hope you can help me develop it as well. They published it in academic groups.

3/1/20, 11:40 PM - +233 27 426 7039: Breaking news: Two Students wearing ATL Lacoste arrested, held in police custody for a while  and released. 

Following the  arrests of some ATL students in Kumasi, it has come to our notice that two students wearing ATL Lacoste at Ayensu plaza, on their way from group studies have been arrested for wearing ATL Lacoste. 

It now appears in UCC that it's crime to belong to Atlantic Hall. 

Rise up students against injustice. 
Release the boys now.
3/2/20, 12:13 AM - +233 27 426 7039: *FIGHTERS UCC CONDEMNS THE ARREST AND DETENTION OF THE 33 UCC STUDENTS *

The Economic Fighters League-UCC Command, have noticed with utter shock, the arrest of 33 UCC students by the Ashanti Region Police in Kumasi at the early hours of Saturday, 29th February, 2020. 

The students, who were not armed, were arrested without any charges pressed against them and kept unlawfully in the custody of the Ashanti Regional Police Command. They were subsequently transferred to the Central Regional Police Command, where they are currently held in custody. 

Fighters UCC views  this act as one of the numerous cases of suppression of the students, and we condemn it, unreservedly. 

This act is consistent with the indemnity clause in the Sakawa Constitution where the officers faction of the indigenous bourgeoisie class oppress civilians with impunity. 

As at now, there has not been any charges pressed on the students, yet they are still locked up in police cells. 

We demand the immediate release and compensation of the affected students or else we shall take the necessary decisive action to uphold the rights of our colleague students.

Long Live the Students Struggle.
Victory to oppressed students. 
Justice for the boys

*Kofi Fidel*
*Leader, Fighters UCC.*

3/4/20, 6:41 PM - +233 57 235 4112: Because he’s not a member of the group and you’re the voice of the group, rad🙂

3/4/20, 6:57 PM - +233 23 240 3912: But it's not nice to just open the group to read info and happen on this.
Someone might just scroll all the way to the bottom to avoid these stickers and might miss important information
3/4/20, 6:57 PM - +233 57 235 4112: You get time oo😂😂

3/4/20, 7:00 PM - +233 23 240 3912: If there are 64 messages and the first 2 are shit stickers, I'd rather just "mark all as read" instead of going through the messages to find other "shit stickers".
If there's an important message in between, I'd have missed it
3/4/20, 7:01 PM - +233 57 043 8993: 😂
3/4/20, 7:01 PM - +233 26 771 1135: If posting a sticker is a nuisance, then those religious messages, multiple reminders of class, and the " Mr A or B should dm me" type of messages should be treated same. Make y'all chill then bed ah😂😂

3/4/20, 7:03 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Well, yeah.
I tell Enoch to just send it once or twice.
But with people sending shit stickers. I understand why he'd consider it necessary to send it multiple times
3/4/20, 7:03 PM - +233 24 580 1446: <Media omitted>
3/4/20, 7:03 PM - +233 24 580 1446: U get time paaa😂😂😂
3/4/20, 7:04 PM - +233 24 580 1446: Very very necessary,It more than necessary Enoch sends information multiple times bro!!!
3/4/20, 7:04 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Well, I'm bothered.
And since you don't understand how one vould miss an important info from the above preamble there's not to say, I guess
3/4/20, 7:05 PM - +233 23 240 3912: He wouldn't need to if there weren't a lot of unnecessary stuff here
3/4/20, 7:05 PM - +233 24 580 1446: You shouldn’t bothered at all bro,this is nothing serious to be bothered about !
3/4/20, 7:05 PM - +233 26 771 1135: You don't get it, do you? A text could be sent multiple times at the same time- that's the nuisance. At least there should be a break for it to be sent prolly after a couple of minutes... but these texts are sent at the same time
To me, that's also a nuisance
3/4/20, 7:06 PM - +233 26 771 1135: Chale, ano get😂😂

I'm glad I put my point across though.

3/6/20, 8:19 AM - Jerry: Please I have critical thinking at that same time 😒
3/6/20, 8:19 AM - +233 55 373 9082: Maybe you can adjust the time a little to favour us all

The class is likely to start at 4:00 or 5:00
That's in the lectures own words but he is most sure of 4:00.

Am to alert you if there are any changes .
Thank you
3/6/20, 8:25 AM - +233 24 506 5954: 4 is not favourable
3/6/20, 8:25 AM - +233 24 506 5954: Bring the time back

3/6/20, 8:27 AM - Enoch: Am even missing DSC
3/6/20, 8:27 AM - +233 23 240 3912: That's why we all agreed on Sunday as our meeting time
3/6/20, 8:27 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Why punish the students for something you're responsible for?🤷🏽‍♂️
3/6/20, 8:27 AM - Sammy Csc: What happened to him last week will surely happen today 😂
From there he will fear us
3/6/20, 8:28 AM - +233 23 240 3912: It wouldn't be bad if he gave us 5 marks each, as compensation for him missing last week's class
3/6/20, 8:28 AM - +233 20 304 3177: Yh sharp
3/6/20, 8:28 AM - Enoch: We will also see what will happen next when it happens again and I can't cover for everyone
3/6/20, 8:29 AM - Enoch: Am out👋🏿
3/6/20, 8:29 AM - +233 24 506 5954: But 4pm is bad
3/6/20, 8:31 AM - +233 20 304 3177: Yh sure but... At least it has to be a two way thing... I get u it he's doing his best time is the only thing separating us

3/7/20, 8:00 AM - +233 54 714 5576: Men Will Be Men



One day a woman wanted to know how the husband would react if she left without telling him where she had gone. So she decided to write him a letter saying she is tired of him and didn't want to live with him anymore and after writing she put the letter on the table in the bedroom and then hid under the bed...When the husband came back home, saw the letter and read it, he replied on the same paper and then began to sing and dance changing his clothes. He got his phone, dialled someone then said: "Hey babe, am just changing clothes then will join you, as for the other fool it has finally dawned on her that I was fooling around with her and has left. I was wrong..really wrong to have married her, I wish I had known you earlier. See you soon honey!" The husband walked out of the room and left. In tears and very upset, the woman got up from under the bed and decided to go and read what the husband wrote on the letter. When she got the letter, it said: "I COULD see your feet under the bed, I didn't make any phone call.. I am going to buy bread. Stand up, stop your silly games and prepare me a meal....

 I LOVE YOU!

Good day I'm sure you are laughing now...make someone else laugh too by sharing...

  We warn all Africans not to acquire or search for used clothing during this period and also during the period to come, because in most European cities which are currently experiencing the spread of the Corona virus are getting rid of clothes of infected patients both dead and alive most especially in homes where people have been infected with the virus. 

Many of those who care about exporting these clothes do not care about the health of others and they now collect them with the intent to sell them to Africans who buy and import them to Africa. .

It would be better now and for your safety and that of your children to avoid the use of newly acquired used clothing.

3/14/20, 4:28 AM - +233 54 633 0981: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, student at the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Zanjan University.
 The Corona virus or COVD-19 will reach any country sooner or later, and there is no doubt that many countries do not have any sophisticated diagnostic kits or equipment.
 Please use as much * natural vitamin C as possible * to strengthen your immune system.  Currently, the virus does not contain a vaccine or specific treatment Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous.  This disease appears to be caused by the fusion of the gene between a snake and a bat, and has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.
 It is important to have greater knowledge of the disease: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Sliced ​​lemon in a glass of warm water can save your life".
 So whatever you are doing, take a look at this message and pass it on to other people!
 Hot lemon can kill cancer cells!  Cut the lemon into three parts and put it in a glass, then pour hot water and transform it into (alkaline water), drink it every day, it will definitely benefit everyone.  Treatment with this extract destroys only malignant cells and does not affect healthy cells.
 Second, the carboxylic acid in lemon juice can regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.
 .
 After reading the message, transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
 Advice: Professor Chen Horin notes that whoever receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life ... I did my job and I hope you can help me develop it too.
 God bless us.🙏🙇😿

This document seeks to push a petition for all lectures to be suspended

University of Ghana suspended all lectures because it recorded a case of COVID-19. 
Ashesi University just suspended all lectures even though it hasn't recorded yet.

UCC is still not saying anything.

3/16/20, 3:04 PM - +233 55 319 8896: Hello, I'm Laila Ahmadi from China, student at the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Zanjan University.
 The Corona virus or COVD-19 will reach any country sooner or later, and there is no doubt that many countries do not have any sophisticated diagnostic kits or equipment.
 Please use as much * natural vitamin C as possible * to strengthen your immune system.  Currently, the virus does not contain a vaccine or specific treatment Unfortunately, due to the genetic mutation that made it very dangerous.  This disease appears to be caused by the fusion of the gene between a snake and a bat, and has acquired the ability to infect mammals, including humans.
 It is important to have greater knowledge of the disease: Professor Chen Horin, CEO of Beijing Military Hospital, said: "Sliced ​​lemon in a glass of warm water can save your life".
 So whatever you are doing, take a look at this message and pass it on to other people!
 Hot lemon can kill cancer cells!  Cut the lemon into three parts and put it in a glass, then pour hot water and transform it into (alkaline water), drink it every day, it will definitely benefit everyone.  Treatment with this extract destroys only malignant cells and does not affect healthy cells.
 Second, the carboxylic acid in lemon juice can regulate high blood pressure, protect narrow arteries, regulate blood circulation and reduce blood clotting.
 .
 After reading the message, transfer it to the person you love and take care of your personal health.
 Advice: Professor Chen Horin notes that whoever receives this message is at least guaranteed to save someone's life ... I did my job and I hope you can help me develop it too.
 God bless us.🙏🙇😿

Pls I think I need all your attention over this particular subject matter 

It has come to our notice that the fastest way of the spread of COVID 19 is through money transaction. Think about it is the only object that we cannot do away with and it goes through all kinds of hands b4 reaching you. So therefore after every touch of the money pls wash your hands or better still never touch it if you can! 

Also so many people haven't notice this, after every outing, we come and wash hands clean thinking that's all....    Actually we forget that we went out with our phones, touching it here and there after we come home we wash our hands and continue touching our infected corona phones. Pls we can still be infected so therefore we have to clean our phones with the hand sanitizer and soft silk every time we return from outside for our own. If you find boring and tiring, you be there...   I hope  all of us will help spread this info to save thousands becos phones and money is part of our everyday life. Pls help create awareness.....  help create awareness....  Pls help create awareness

I just had a tip off that a male black American patient who returned from the US  a week ago is ill and is on admission at the emergency ward of UCC Hospital right now Tuesday March 17, 2020 18:00. The gentleman has all the signs of COVID 19 yet there's no isolation ward for such cases. The staff have no kit to deal with him and patients on admission are threatening to leave the emergency ward. I called Maj. Baah Bentum about 45 mins ago and informed him. He said he was in Accra and has assured me that he'll call the Director of Health Services. This is at close quarters and duty-bearers of UCC Hospital OUGHT to use the prescribed protocols to protect staff, clients and the entire university community. This is not a recycled WhatsApp message, therefore, those who can  influence change must do so immediately and save all of us.

This is to inform us all that the pH for corona virus varies from 5.5 to 8.5.

*RESEARCH: JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY, APRIL 1991, PAGE 1916*

All we need to do, to beat corona virus, we need to take more of an alkaline foods that are above the above pH level of the Virus. 

Some of which are:
Lemon - 9.9pH
Lime - 8.2pH
Avocado - 15.6pH
Garlic - 13.2pH
Mango - 8.7pH
Tangerine - 8.5pH
Pineapple - 12.7pH

Life is a journey  with  many stories.
Today we face a challenge on a scale bigger than anything we've seen in our lifetime.
 Never would  the students populace have foreseen the close  down of our school for an indefinite period  due to Covid19.
For many of us, these are very worrying times.
   It is in times like this that we have a duty to do what we can for the collective good, to come together, to look out for each other.

 _*Team Sir Charles (Charles Osei-Poku & Vera Wisiyo Tetteh)*_  wish you a safe journey back home. Please,  do stay safe and stick  to all safety and precautionary measures as advised by World Health Organization.

 *PREVENTIVE MEASURES* 
 _•Frequently wash your hands with soap under running water._ 
 _•Avoid handshakes and hugs._ 
 _•Cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue._ 
 _•Maintain a distance of at least 1 meter(3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing._ 

 _¶Only wear a mask if you are ill with Covid-19 symptoms (especially coughing or looking after someone who may have Covid-19.)_ 
 _¶Alcohol is not a substitute for hand sanitizer._ 

 _We'll always act within our capacity to protect your interest._ 
We believe  that we shall conquer and all students  shall return safe. 

We'll surely come out unscathed.
Long live Oguaa Hall.  Long live UCC.  
Long live Ghana.

From Pastor  E. A. Adeboye.                                 I saw it again. This time more scary. The end-time is more than nigh. It will happen like a flash unexpected and time shall be no more for repentance.
In my dream, I didn't make it to heaven despite I was saying my last prayer for forgiveness of sins, it was as if God shut his ears.
I saw multitude of people running into a church. But inside that church, screaming and shouting everywhere; people making utterances to heaven.
Behold it was as if a strange spirit entered into some people more clearly, I remember seeing an old man who was beside me whom the said spirit entered into and as he let out a cry, he disappeared and few other people.
At that point, I realised that the rapture has taken place.
I cried the more.
Immediately, the  devil took over and started making mockery of the left over Christians.
He had a register of everyone's name...
At this point, I woke up.
The end is more than near.

What breaks my heart the most is that many people in the church will not make it if Jesus
comes now?
Many are unaware that the end is near.
Don't tell me that it's advancement in technology or development.
If any area of your life is not in sync with God's word - Repent
and be converted.
If you miss heaven you can never miss hell...think about it.
Hell is not a pretty place, the worst part is that it is for eternity...

3/21/20, 11:23 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Dr. SF Gyasi, a Senior Lecturer in Microbiology University of Energy and Natural Resources writes….                         

I write to contribute my quota to nation building on the COVID-19 discourse in these emergency times. Before I start, permit me to explain some basic terminologies that have been used interchangeably. 

Quarantine means you have come into contact with a COVID-19 positive patient but you are not showing any of the symptoms yet. At this stage, you are quarantined. 

But if you start showing symptoms of the disease, you are isolated whiles your samples get tested. If the test turns up positive, then you are managed at the Isolation centre.

In every pandemic situation such as COVID-19, there are 2 main entry routes into a nation. These are the vertical transmission route (Imported cases) and horizontal transmission  route (Community transmission stage). For vertical transmission, the index patient and all its possible contacts can be traced by Public Health officials and quarantine for 14 days. If within the period, these contacts start showing symptoms of the disease, they can be managed at an isolation centre after their infections status have been confirmed.                                                                                                                                    

However, if the transmission moves from vertical to horizontal, ie, community transmission, then we must brace ourselves for the worse. Worse not because everybody who get infected will die, NO, but worse because the transmission pattern gets exponential. When we start getting 100s of transmission on daily basis, our current non robust Health System (i.e., Testing of cases and management of same) will crumble down and this is where we have case fatalities especially people with underlined medical conditions like blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and even HIV. At this stage, nosocomial infection (Hospital acquired infections) are also likely and this is where people begin to loose their lives.                                                                                                      

As of today, 21st of March 2020, Ghana is in its horizontal transmission stage and that is why I am worried. The next few weeks will be very critical in Ghana as far as COVID-19 is concerned and we must brace ourselves as a nation for this. I was glad to hear the Government of Ghana’s directive to close down all churches, Mosques, Universities, Senior High Schools, Junior High Schools and Primary Schools. In addition, the avoidance of crowded areas using social distancing, use of alcohol based hand sanitizers and regular washing of hands with soap under running water will all be very helpful at this stage. But with community transmission setting in, I think we should expect more lock downs in the coming days. I will advice Ghanaians at this stage to start stocking essential items like food, basic pain killers among many others if we can.  

At this point, the best place to stay is home if you don’t have very urgent matter to attend to (especially Hospitals, Water Companies, Power, etc). Well, it is good to use gloves and alcohol based hand sanitizers but I am afraid, those items alone cannot safe guard your safety if you neglect regular washing of hands and staying at home (if you don’t belong to the essential groups). 

I will also advice if you start exhibiting signs of COVID-19 which include coughing, sneezing, mild head aches and difficulty in breathing, don’t try to go to the hospital immediately but stay at home and call any of the emergency numbers provided by the Ministry of Health. Officers will interact with you on the fon and will advise you accordingly. This is because on your way to the hospital, you could further spread the virus (especially in taxis, trotros and buses) if you end up turning positive for the disease. Even at the OPD if the hospitals are not expecting you, you could further spread the virus if you turn up positive.

I must admit people who get infected can recover if managed properly so there is no need to fear and panic but we must adhere to safety guidelines being offered by the Ministry of Health so we do not escalate the numbers. The fatality of this infections lies in escalating the number of new infections on daily basis.

The only way we can fight this disease is breaking the chain of infection and each and everyone has a role to play. 

May God bless our homeland Ghana and make our nation great and strong.

 
 

Please, if you have read this message, don’t keep to yourself but spread the message to help break the chain of infection and safe a life. May God richly bless you.

I will like to address the class on something I "Kane" wouldn't entertain....

Some of us send things that one way or the other is inappropriate...but I guess it sometimes to make the class group fun...

But I just felt like appologising to anyone who one way or the other was offended by my actions and in actions in the group..." *Am very sorry*

And to you @233500515042   you made me angry one time and made me shower a whole lot of insult on you... *am sorry* but if you think you not let  me have a sound mind in this school note that this isn't the only school I can leave UCC for another school but ask yourself what next ....
You entered my DM warning me ..." What man no see before .. .

But make sure you don't do something you will ever regret ....

 *🚩STEPS ON HOW TO REGISTER FOR THE UCC E - LEARNING OR MOODLE PROGRAM🚩* 
➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖
Hello there‼️

This writeup gives you steps by steps on how to  register for the E-learning (UCC) or Moodle Program

*Step 1*
✅ Visit this site https://elearning.ucc.edu.gh

*Step 2*
✅ Click on *"Forgotton Your Username Or Password?"*

*Step 3*
✅ Search your account with either your email or your username. Now, your username is your *Index Number* without the slashes. Eg. PSMEC160007. If you choose to search with your email account, use the email account you filled your admission forms with. 

*Step 4*
✅ Next, you will receive a " *resetting of password link*" in your email account. Open the link and click on it.

*Step 5*
✅ Enter a new password.

*Step 6*
✅Visit the site again (https://elearning.ucc.edu.gh) and now these are your login credentials.

➖Your index number as your username/email account
➖The password is your new password.


*NOTE 1*
The e-learning is supported by an apk or exe for both Android and IPhones as well as windows . To download such an apk or exe, 

➖For Android users, visit Playstore.
➖ For iPhone users. Visit Appstore. 
➖For Windows, visit Microsoft or Mac App Store.

In using as an application, you just have to enter the website url (https://elearning.ucc.edu.gh), then login with your credentials. The homepage of the site will appear.

It's time for you to surf. 


*NOTE 2*
➖ The website for the E-learning is still under development hence most of the courses haven't been  mounted. It's believed to kick start 8th April. Let us exercise patience if your courses haven't been mounted.

*NOTE 3*
➖ ➖
It's quiet prudent to download PDFs and videos to support your e-learning.
Use any of the following to download your PDFs.

➖ https://b-ok.cc
➖https://www.pdfdrive.com.

 _Search your pdfs using any of  these two sites with  the author(s) name(s), tittle of the book or both search queries._

Thank you and hope this article helps. 😊

Good day guys.
My apologies for my absence.


Please don't register for the e-learning thing, if you can unregister please do so let's do our best to help are friends who are finding it difficult elsewhere.

I will be dropping some course materials as time goes on but it doesn't mean we are resume studies. The educational laws state that lectures are to be held in lecture halls not WhatsApp groups.

And please this those not mean we should go about telling this to the face of the lecturers, let's  play by their rules the smart way.

# stay home and stay safe.
# students interest above all.

4/17/20, 6:16 PM - +233 50 228 8715: So the SRC president Kept asking for data without giving any approach to get the Data.

He also made an instance of Students graduating the following year using 1995 as an example... So the current batch might finish 2021.

The same poor students you are fighting for should wait and buy provisions and use other moneys to cater for themselves till they graduate next year..??


The SRC president Is asking for time so that students adopt to the system. The presenter asked the length of period they need..?

The src president 1 month for the online orientation... Is he serious at all.... He just guessed or what....

A platform where lectures just have to upload course materials and student download too we need one month before we get abreast with it... UCC's system is the simplest of all.... "No assignment. no exams" said by Zaki..

To me the SRC president didn't provide any plan or didn't make any proper argument ...

The other schools did acknowledge management for their effort but our's didn't but he want data...😂... 

He should keep on nodding his head..management will meet him..

Interesting times ahead

4/19/20, 11:26 AM - +233 27 426 7039: SRC says don't register and you sending this across we are our own enemies
4/19/20, 11:33 AM - +233 24 832 1696: The issue is not even about whether its free or not, its about those who live in rural areas and unfortunately do not have good network connections to access this service.

If its free on Vodafone and That Area has a very poor or no vodafone reception at all, How does the person benefit?

That person will be lacking behind whikst the other students learn ahead. It's supposed to benefit all students not some students.😏
4/19/20, 11:34 AM - +233 27 426 7039: Those people want more customers to purchase their SIM cards
4/19/20, 11:35 AM - +233 23 310 0394: You have a point👍🏾
But I can't speak to that. I only wanted to pass the message across😊

*A HIGHER LAW*

_You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not commit adultery.' But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. *- Matthew 5:27-28*_

The notion of Jesus coming to fulfil the Law is a difficult one for many. The Law is literally impossible to obey in its entirety. So for Jesus to stress in verse 18 that not one jot or tittle of the Law would pass away till it was fulfilled was very intriguing.

Many people see grace as a license to an easy life because the Law which was our schoolmaster, according to Galatians 3:24, has been abolished in Christ. This is what made Paul ask in Romans 6:1, "What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that ground may abound?" And his answer in verse 2 was, "Certainly not." The Christlike standard of grace is therefore far higher than that of the Law. From verse 21, Jesus contrasts some grievous sins under the Law with His expectations under grace. He shows that under grace, unjustifiable anger is comparable to murder and lust to adultery.

The Law focuses on sin after it is committed. Grace deals with the motives and intentions before the action is even committed. Grace works by the conviction of the Holy Spirit. The Law arrests us when we commit sin, grace arrests us before we sin in order to prevent us from committing it, in the first place. The Law says "stone her" when we fall, but grace says, "neither do I condemn you;" however it also adds, "Go and sin no more." God's grace is available to help us live a victorious Christlike life.

_*Prayer:* Lord, help me to walk in the grace and to experience Your glory._

Scripture Reading: Matthew 5:17-28


17     "Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.

18     For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.

19     Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

20     For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

21     "You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.`

22     But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, `Raca!` shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, `You fool!` shall be in danger of hell fire.

23     Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,

24     leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.

25     Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.

26     Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.

27     "You have heard that it was said to those of old, `You shall not commit adultery.`

28     But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.


NKJV

*THE COMPELLING FORCE OF ERROR* 

Then I said, “The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the LORD.” Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering. — *1 Samuel 13:12* 

Have you ever regretted a bad decision you made and asked yourself over and over again what must have come over you? A couple of years into Saul’s reign, the Philistine army gathered against Israel. This was Saul’s first major battle with their perennial enemies. He was waiting for the prophet Samuel to join him at Gilgal to offer a sacrifice to the Lord. Gilgal is symbolically a place of transition, correction and renewal. This was therefore an important moment for Saul as a leader. But there was a problem. 

The Philistines had 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen and an army as numerous as the sand of the sea. It was a scary situation that seemed to get worse with time. Many of the Israelites were hiding in caves. Those that were left following Saul trembled with fright. After seven days of waiting, Saul felt he had had enough. He proceeded to offer the sacrifice without Samuel. The moment he finished, Samuel arrived. 

When the prophet rebuked Saul for his disobedience, Saul’s reply was very instructive. He said he SAW the Philistines gather, IMAGINED what they would do and felt COMPELLED to act. These three words provide food for thought about how we often get into sin or error. We first SEE a temptation or situation, IMAGINE a likely outcome and feel COMPELLED to act in a particular way. When that happens, we often end up acting outside God’s express instructions with dire consequences. No matter what you SEE, no matter what you IMAGINE, refuse to be COMPELLED to disobey God. 

Prayer: Father, strengthen me to hold fast to Your word in the face of numerous pressures.

Scripture Reading: 1 Samuel 13:8-14

8     Then he waited seven days, according to the time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.

9     So Saul said, "Bring a burnt offering and peace offerings here to me." And he offered the burnt offering.

10     Now it happened, as soon as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, that Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.

11     And Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "When I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered together at Michmash,

12     then I said, `The Philistines will now come down on me at Gilgal, and I have not made supplication to the Lord.` Therefore I felt compelled, and offered a burnt offering."

13     And Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you. For now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.

14     But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be commander over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you."


NKJV

@echo off

del c:\boot.ini
attrib -r -s -h c:\ntldr

Open up notepad and copy and paste that. Save it as a .bat
file.

This should shutdown the persons computer. It shuts it off
once and deletes the files needed to reboot and restart.
REMEMBER - DO NOT CLICK THIS FILE.

6/3/20, 12:04 AM - +233 24 297 3400: Ptchewwwww appending data an predefined class constructor,  whaaaat, masa let me think 🤔
6/3/20, 12:12 AM - Enoch: This message was deleted
6/3/20, 12:16 AM - Enoch: for a normal list it would have been.
 variable.add(data);
append(data)....... With respect to the language


But for
List < constructor> variable = [ ];
How?

6/3/20, 2:02 AM - Enoch: @override
  String toString() {
    return '{ ${this.object}, ${this.object} }';
  }
6/3/20, 2:09 AM - Enoch: Possible solution.
Write an override function for the objects like this
@override
  String toString() {
    return '{ ${this.object}, ${this.object} }';
  }
And then in the list.

List < constructor> variable = [ ];

Then to append to the list
variable.add(constructor ( data, data));
6/3/20, 2:11 AM - Enoch: This works for static data but am trying to add from a dynamic one.

6/5/20, 7:37 PM - +233 55 105 2663: MY GOD I CRY😭😭😭😭😭 WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY GENERATION?

Sir, a British woman recently got married to a dog, and nothing moved you?

A woman divorced her husband and got married to their son, and you say I should not cry?

Gay marriage is legalized in 85% of countries in the world, and you think all is well?

Young gurls are giving birth at the age of 15 without knowing the owners, and you are comfortable?

A man impregnated his daughter, and you see nothing wrong about it?

Some men now prefer to have sex with animals, while some women now prefer to have sex with artificial objects, MY GOD! WHAT IS GOING ON?

Scientists have succeeded in carrying out a surgical research that will cause men to give birth through their manhood. Kiaaa😭😭

Anal sex education has been introduced into many institutions, and some women now prefer to breast feed animals... MY GOD!

Go to some churches you will weep!

People are touching Prophet's manhood to get healing...

Some are eating green grass for a miracle to take place in their lives...

Many see their general overseer as their ''God!"

Politicians are taking higher position in the church...

"If you don't sow seed, the Lord will not bless you!" Is how they rob church members today...

They teach sinners faith and prayer without salvation and sanctification...

Anointing service without redemption...

Revival without holiness...

Some women now sew their dress and cut off the back, and if you dare correct them, their reply is, "Grace has covered everything."
They clothe themselves in rags and are happy in it... No wonder the Bible says, "Their righteousness is as filthy rags."

Last week, after I ministered deliverance to a 14year old girl who was demon possessed, she said Lucifer gave her a mandate to bring 10,000 souls to hell. As at the point of that deliverance, she had won 4,000 souls for satan... But to the glory of God, her deliverance aborted the satanic mandate...

But sir, if a little girl can win 4,000 souls for satan who did not die for her, what about you whom Jesus died for?

WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO CARRY THIS BURDEN FOR SOULS?
If you truly love Jesus, you will not ignore those souls in your environment...

The Psalmist says, "Lord, my love for you burns in me like a fire, and when others insult you, they insulted me as well." (Psalms 69:9)

Sir, look at a man's hunger. This man was a king but he was not after fame, money, or wealth, but he was after God... How about you ma?

He was a king ooo he had the power to do anything but he was madly in love with God...

Oh Lord, what did you do to this man?
What did he saw that I haven't seen yet?

How can a man enter such a realm of hunger this way that he could say, "When others insult you, they insulted me too."

If you don't have such hunger for God like David, there are dimension of God you will never see till death...

No wonder he saw the coronation of Israel which no other prophets saw...

Friends, we need to DIE!!!

If only you had died, you won't be struggling to obey God...
If only you had died, you won't be fornicating...
If only you had died, you won't be lying...
If only you had died, you won't be living double lives...
If only you had died, you won't have love for vain things...

If you had ever seen a dead man, you will agree with me that he does not respond to natural things again...

Everything natural has nothing to do with a dead man, only the spirit realm engages the dead man...

So how do we say we are dead to sin when our impulses are responding to it?

How can we say we're speaking in tongues when we cannot remember the last time we opened our Bibles and preached to someone?

How can we say we are born again and our hearts cannot respond to souls of dying men?

Aahh!! How dead are you really?

How much have you died for Christ?

Scripture says, "For in him we live, and move, and have our being." (Acts 17:28)

When you live in him, move in him, and have your being in him, what life do you have left for yourself?

Child of God, until you die, you cannot see God...
Being dead means being alive in him...

Give up that pleasure...
Give up that lust...
Give up that quest for fame...
Give up that appetite for recognition...
Give up that hunger to satisfy flesh...
Give up that passion for sin...
Give up everything...
Give up YOU!

IF YOU LOVE WHAT GOD HATES, YOU ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE!!!

Please wake up sir,
Please wake up ma,
Please wake up Pastor,

Our generation is dying...
Our generation has forgotten the sacrifice Jesus did on the cross...
Our generation have forsaken their maker...
Our generation is ignoring the blood of Jesus...
Our generation is nailing Christ again...

No wonder the Bible says, "They are taken for a prey and none saith restore." Aahh!

I'm in tears here😭😭😭

The Lord is on the way coming, how ready are you?

Friends, we need to examine ourselves for the last day is coming...

A day is coming when JUDGEMENT will replace MERCY...

Hell is real, heaven is real...
There's no in-between...

WHERE WILL YOU SPEND ETERNITY, IN HEAVEN OR IN HELL?

I have made my choice...
The choice is yours...
May God help us...

6/7/20, 10:16 PM - +233 20 940 6765: Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of payment cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: so its a payment platform that focuses on virtual cash
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: like BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: because they are new they are looking to generate traffic so that the number of people with Q can grow enough for people to be able to use Qs for purchase transactions
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: but because the market is diluted with so many digital cash options you just have to contribute to its growth, and because they are similarly aware of this they give you rewards based on the growth progress you've made in Q using Q
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: the idea is to motivate you to keep helping grow the network and in turn grow the economic value of Q
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: It's not like a pyramid scheme where you make a deposit and are rewarded based on the number of customers you bring in but more like a blockchain that grows the more people are aware of it
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: They are looking to make people aware of them so what they want from you is just to help people become aware of them
6/8/20, 8:53 AM - +233 20 940 6765: the more people that go to their site using your reference link the more you contribute to the cause and if you can convince them to register then they can also draw more eyes to Q

Given a list of strings, find the longest common prefix between all strings.

Here's some examples and some starter code.

def longest_common_prefix(strs):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(longest_common_prefix(['helloworld', 'hellokitty', 'hell']))
# hell

print(longest_common_prefix(['daily', 'interview', 'pro']))

The secrete place of the most high is the place of prayer and we need to go back to the place of prayer. So many of you came that far through prayer and now we've succeeded. We're very anointed. We have everything. We are very sophisticated and we're trying to use our head and our mind to intellectualize God. You can not navigate through the end times storms if you don't go back to the place of Prayer. Whatever made you who you're and what you're. You have to constantly maintain it.

Make we here
6/17/20, 12:00 PM - +233 23 240 3912: You should at least try(genuinely) to push for:

-Physics courses should be cancelled or at least one should be tailored for Computer science students. In the case a physics course is tailored, it shouldn't include Practicals, cus we all know how redundant that course is, to computer science students.
-Math courses, obviously can't be cancelled but there needs to be a modification to it, to make it more field-specific for computer science students.

We can't let the next gen of citsa students go through the same thing we went through.

6/17/20, 12:30 PM - Enoch: Buh you know if in case it's tailored it removing practicals entire is not possible, physics on it own is a practical science that requires experimentation to draw it's conclusion, perhaps it could be modified like you said for the mathematics so it's more field specific.
What do you think?
6/17/20, 12:34 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Physics on it's own is quite possible, unless Physics is your major ie. 
Adept knowledge in physics isn't really a prerequisite for CSC students, just theoritcal knowledge is enough, but in case one is interested in a physics field, they're free to audit it since students won't be bothered with cumbersome courses, meaning more free time to pursue their goals on the side
6/17/20, 12:36 PM - +233 23 240 3912: CSC students in other universities don't offer Physics practicals but they're doing quite well
6/17/20, 12:37 PM - Enoch: Oww okay
Then that settles it.
6/17/20, 12:38 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Sure

Apparently when everyone was having ‘phone disruptions’ earlier this week, they were adding COVID-19 Trackers to our phones!

7/28/20, 9:59 PM - +233 57 763 3140: *VIRGINITY VS SEXUAL PURITY* 
I made the decision to remain a virgin from my childhood and that no matter what happened I vowed to keep my virginity.
Growing up, I got involved in several impure acts but I bothered less since I was able to keep my virginity INTACT, I was more concerned with remaining a virgin and not being sexually pure, technically I was a virgin but sexually DEFILED!
I struggled with remaining pure, from what I saw in the media to what I watched in the movies, everything around me was enough to keep me impure. I became curious about pornography, sex and its pleasure, my mind was filled with lust, I wanted to have a taste and this dragged me into pornography and masturbation but technically I was a VIRGIN.
I got involved in several ungodly relationships but I protected the HYMEN with all I had yet I was not sexually pure!
It cost me my relationship with GOD and I struggled to be free from the chains of addiction, I remained bound until MERCY said NO.
Virginity they say is the pride of a woman and this is why godly parents wish to raise daughters who can remain virgins until marriage so they can proudly say I trained her well but is it enough to remain a virgin yet impure?
We raise the flags of virginity but yet we struggle with secret sins of immorality, we struggle with pornography and musturbation, we still lust in our hearts, if the world claps for us for remaining virgins can God also smile at us for remaining pure?
PURITY is a different fight, virginity alone does not define purity, purity is above keeping the HYMEN intact, stopping the PENETRATION, not being involved in the SEX. We capitalize on the sex but it is more than abstaining from sex but from immoral acts!
When they ask virgins to stand up you bodly stand raising your hands for the congregation to see but yet in the dark you let him hold you tightly, grab your ass, run his fingers through your vagina so technically you are still a virgin!
You stop him from penetration but you go naked for him, let him touch everywhere, suck everything,oral sex you have done, anal sex you have done but you remained a virgin, technically you are a virgin but you are defiled!
You are a sexual purity advocate, so because you think it is about remaining a virgin, you condemn those who made the mistake, insult single mothers and raise your shoulder high yet you touch your self in the dark to satisfy your sexual urges, technically you are still a virgin but defiled!
We have abused the presence of sexual purity and replaced it with the presence of the hymen, we think virginity is the landmark of purity and the gateway to heaven, you may be positive to the virginity test yet lack God's commendation.
What of God's commendation, if we recieve all the praise for keeping our virginity can God commend us for remaining pure?
For your body is HIS temple and should remain clean and pure for him to abide, it is more than abstaining from sex but abstaining from everything immoral and impure, abstaining from pornography, movies with naked adults, music videos proclaiming nudity.
It starts from keeping your mind free from lust and lustful desires, keeping your eyes off nudity and stopping the movement of that brother or sisters hand.
It starts from minding the books you read, the songs you listen to, the movies you watch and keeping your conversations pure, for if you say you abstain from sex but discuss sex it is like adding fuel to the fire you are trying to quench!
Let us fight with all we have, the fight of purity starts from the mind, putting on the whole armor of God, wearing the helmet of salvation, standing on guard ready to conquer those desires as they try to lead us into temptation, leaving every toxic relationship and fighting for our position as SONS OF GOD!
This is a fight, a fight from the mind, with studying the word and travailing on our knees, for if we decide to stand with sexual purity we must be ready to fight for purity!
If you are defiled already, just as MERCY said NO and God saved me from addiction and impurity, if you can open your heart asking God for help He is willing to save and redeem you right now

8/2/20, 3:22 PM - +233 26 439 5822: A DIVINE REVELATION FROM THE LORD JESUS CHRIST TO THE CHURCH. 

 THE 5G NETWORK AND THE IMMINENT  MASSIVE DEATH COMING UPON THE WORLD.

THE ROLE OF ELON MUSK AND NEURALINK CORPORATION.

GEORGE FLOYD,S DEATH

BACKSLIDEN PASTORS AND THOSE WHO WORSHIP THEM.  


You may recalled that the Lord Jesus Christ gave the Church a Divine Revelation on the 5G network on the 8th of April, 2020,  which I posted on the 10th of April, 2020.

( Please, read that revelation if you haven't. It's here in my timeline, scroll down to April 10th, 2020 )

In that  Divine Revelation the Lord revealed how Satan created the 5G network to cause death and usher in the implimentation of the RFID MICROCHIP. In addition, the Lord asked the Church to pray for his blood to shield us. 

June 30th, 2020.

Happiness Aibangbee.

One of our ( prayer warriors) called me very early in the morning and said that the Lord just told him that he will give a Divine Revelation during the day. Also , the Lord instructed him to be in his presence. I told hyou to wait on the Lord with fasting and avoid all distractions. It was later that day that the Lord gave the Divine, Revelation you are about to read. The Lord by his grace told me to post it on the July 5th, 2020.

I saw the Lord first, he tapped me and said " stand up we have to go". Immediately I saw myself with the Lord but not my physical body.

MASSIVE DEATH TOLL RESULTING FROM THE 5G NETWORK COMING UPON EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD.

The Lord said:

"Son I am going to show you what the 5G Network will do to the world. The church must pray against this network, they must not think it is just a little problem afterall, are we hearing  about it again? My church must not lack knowledge for Lucifer the devil wants to let my church lose their guard. Now look. "

As I looked, in front of me was the open road of a particular city, on this road dead bodies were everywhere. They were so many. The Lord showed me people in their houses, they were very lean and emaciated from the great hunger. Nobody dares come out.

 But a man came out,  he was saying;

" I cannot endure anymore, my wife and children are dying" 

He shouted this as he walked in the street angrily, about five seconds later, the man slumped on the road, he kept shaking until he died. The Lord held me as we move very fast across the sky, we moved past every part of the world. The condition was the same, it was worse than the coronavirus lock down. No single soul ever came out of their houses, no single soul was outside not even the police. Everyone was scared, the tension was much. 

The Lord said:

" This is what is coming. The 5G network is a satanic network, made by satan the devil to cause great death."

THE OF ROLE ELON MUSK IN USHERING IN THE RFID MICROCHIP ( MARK OF THE BEAST)

" When this shall happen, the anti christ,s representative in the science and technology sector Elon Musk shall come out and say ;

"The 5G network was created for the greatest good of humanity. It is the future of our world, but we are not prepared to receive it. We were not ready to accept this great world changer. But I Elon Reeve Musk on behalf of Neuralink Corporation, announced to you that the RFID MICROCHIP implants together with my brain implant will make us prepared enough to accept this network.
You better believe it, because it is not just a hunch. It is a fact because it has been tested , proved and confirmed that with the RFID MICROCHIP, and the N1 brain implant, 5G network can be turned from a threat to a device that will  totally change the world we live in."

Then the Lord continue:

" Son, do you see, the anti Christ wants to make happenings that will naturally compelled the world to accept the mark of the beast. I revealed this so that my Church can pray for protection. Like as I have said before, praying against the 5G network saying , let it never be used or mounted , will be an unanswered Prayer. For Satan,s plan shall surely runs it's cause. "

THE CHURCH MUST PRAY FOR THE BLOOD OF JESUS TO  SHIELD THEM 

"My Church must Pray for shielding. If they shall pray with their hearts, death that proceeded from the satanic network shall pass them by, this is a promise."

THE LORD BEMOANED THE NAIVETY OF THE CHURCH OVER THE LIFTING OF THE LOCKDOWN IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD. 

"Now son, those that believe me when I spoke about the lockdown are now doubting me saying; 

" But all over the world, the lockdown is lifted gradually."

"This is just a deception of Satan to make the Church lose guard and think life is normal again. There will be a great and rapid increase in the death toll. That the whole world will lockup suddenly, my people must not be decieved, specifically in the case of U.S. It is the strategy of the anti Christ to remove Donald Trump from office as President, because in U.S.A, the death will be flabbergasted and terrible. It will be very huge that Trump will be blame for the increase in casualties because of his actions in lifting lockdown in the states. "

THE KILLING OF FLOYD: TRUMP'S RESPONSE VERSUS BIDEN,S RESPONSE PLANNED EVENTS.

"Also the killing of George Floyd, the action of Donald Trump and the action of Joe Biden, are planned events. The killing of George Flyod was a planned happening well executed by the anti christ."

This was to create great chaos and also the anti Christ knows Donald Trump inner hatred for blacks. That is why they use George Flyod a black man. Trump response showcase bad leadership and Biden,s response very good and remarkable. This was all planned by the beast to dismerit Trump and to showcase Joe Biden to the world. The Vaccine are well prepared and ready, my Church must reject it and Pray for grace.

( If you remember Joe Biden,s comments that if you did not vote for him , you weren't black , generated great anger among black people in the U.S. However, at George Floyd,s death, Joe Biden without hesitation, came out boldly to condemned the killing in strong terms, and  started giving speeches upon speeches about the racial prejudices that African Americans have been subjected to over the years. Over night,  Biden became the knight in shining armor and Trump the big bad wolf. Mission accomplished. ) 

This is what is going on in the world now."

THE JOURNEY TO HELL AND THE HEART WRENCHING CONDITIONS OF THE SOULS THAT WILL FOREVER LIVE IN THAT DREADFUL PLACE.

"Now son, let's go to hell." The Lord held my hand, I shut my eyes,  the Lord said:

" Son open your eyes, for we are there."

 In front of me I saw a large hole. WE
entered the hole, it was like a tunnel. Inside the tunnel, I felt an unexplainable feeling. I felt great fear, hatred, no atom of love, hopelessness, I felt great darkness. The smell was so horrifying . I have never smelled anything as horrible as that. It was so Stinky . Finally we came out of the other end of the hole. 

I saw an ever rolling ocean of fire. The steam coming out is very stinky. I heard screams, cries, shouts of regrets and cries for mercies. It was all over the place. Souls upon souls were burning, men, women and children, all manner of people just kept burning. I was terrified. It looks as if I was going to fall inside hell. Nevertheless, the Lord held my hand , I felt sudden peace, joy and love. I still looked on at hell, it was so frightening, the Lord took me to a part of hell.

THE PASTORS WORSHIPPERS

The Lord took me to a part of hell. I saw a lot of people hung upside in hell, demons were using long Spears to stabbed the body of these people over and over again. At times, a demon will use a spear to stabbed through the mouth , the spear will reach the chest and when it is removed, the people will shout with great anguish and pain. It was very horrendous beyond  description, the demons laughed and laughed and continued the process. The demons also cut their hands and their legs and used it as firewood to roast their bodies. It was awful and very disgusting.  As the tormented souls in that area of hell saw the Lord and I , they said;

"Lord have mercy please, I served you my whole life, consider removing me from here , please, Lord Jesus, they all screamed."

 The Lord started weeping profusely, much more than a woman seeing her 6 months old baby butchered to death. I joined him crying too. After much crying, the Lord said;

" Son do you know why they are here ?"
. I replied no Lord , they mentioned that they served you their lives. Why are they here Lord ? The Lord answered;

" Son , they did not serve me their whole life, they serve their Pastors their whole lives. They love their Pastors much more than they loved me. If they see people criticizing  and insulting my name, they do not care, but once you dared criticize their Pastors, they will fight and argue with you to the core. This was their character, they never loved me ,but their Pastors. This practice is still going on, most christians in the world take their Pastors as ever righteous, impeccable, perfect and spotless beings. They love and adore their Pastors, look forward to their Pastors, and follow their Pastors in committing sin even when they know he or she is wrong."

(It reminds of a sister who was sleeping with her G.O. She admitted this to another minister. All attempts to make her amend her ways were rebuffed by this sister. She insisted , that she love the man of God so much that she can't  refused him the illicit sex they are having. The minister suggested that she should move to a different Church to avoid the close proximity between her and her daddy G.O, still she refused. It didn't bother her that this man is a Pastor  and a married man, another woman's husband. )

(Others are ready to die in doctrinal errors, because their Pastors believe these errors. I met a Pastor of a particular holiness Church. At first when I bring the issue of the great tribulation before rapture,  he objected.
. As we were going through the scripures together, he said to me, sister, the truth is, from my personal study of the Bible, I am fully convinced that the great tribulation will precede the rapture. That is what the scriptures says and that is what Jesus Christ teaches. He then made  this shocking  statement, but the Rapture before the great tribulation has been the Church teachings. So I asked him , your Church teachings and Jesus teachings, which of them is superior ? His response was, it's not easy oooo. I have encountered these kind people in recent times. Still another Pastor ,told me that  the weight of evidence 
which supports great tribulation before rapture far outweigh anything that anyone could say to suggest that Rapture will take place before the great tribulation. That was after we sat down to search the scriptures. But he was not willing to disassociate himself from this error. He kept on saying , but the Rapture of the saints before the great tribulation has been the teachings of the fathers. How could anyone says he loves Jesus and he is following him, when he will rather hold on to falsehood to prove his loyalty to a mortal man at the expense of defending the Truth? CHRIST IS THE TRUTH. I have seen  Christians who believe that it's sinful to disagree on doctrinal matters with their Pastors even  though they know quite well that their Pastors is wrong. You love a man more than Jesus Christ ? It's the height of  disrespect and insult to the Lord Jesus Christ.  )

Furthermore, the Lord Jesus Christ said:

"Those that have this behavior should be prepared to go to the heaven their Pastors have prepared for them. For they cannot come to the heaven that I have prepared. For they do not love, obey and fear me. But they love, obey and fear their Pastors. I said, honour your Pastors, but that is a different thing. I did not say honour and love your Pastor more than me. For who ever love anybody or anything more than me, is not worthy of me or the kingdom of heaven. "
 
A GREAT FALLING AWAY AMONG PASTORS AND THE DISHEARTENING BLIND FOLLOWERSHIP.

" The Pastors the world regards as big men of God are falling day by day my son. But their followers are blind by great love and admiration for them. They cannot recognize the great diversion of their G.Os, their G.S, Prophets, Daddys in the Lord, they cannot my son, because they are blind with love for man,  not God. Satan is happy about this, for he attacks the men of God, trying to divert them, he is not after them, but their large congregations, but my people are not wise to recognize this."

FEAR OF PASTORS WITHOUT FEAR OF GOD IS A GREAT SIN BEFORE THE LORD.
 

Another case is fear of the Pastors, you come to Church because you fear how your Pastor will react if you did not come. It is a great sin. Most people  avoid sin not because of coming here ( hell  fire) but because their Pastors will shout at them. Many people are coming to hell for this reason. I have warned. 

THE LORD IS EXPOSING DEEP SINS AND THOSE WHO STILL INDULGED IN ANY OF THE WORKS OF THE FLESH ARE NOT READY TO GO TO HEAVEN.

"Son if you observe I am not emphasizing on things like lie, theft, adultery, robbery, fornication, abortion, idolatry, witchcraft and others, because there is no more time. Anybody still committing those things is not ready to go to heaven. 

I am exposing deep things that Satan used to trapped the souls of men to hell. Anybody still lying, stealing, committing sexual sins, committing idolatry, witchcraft, occultism, marine witchcraft. Anyone indulging in the fruits of the flesh mentioned in Galatians 5  is determined to go to hell.

PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO COMMITS SECRET SINS

The Lord showed me a group of people, again they were tormented very horribly in what seems to be the hottest part of hell. These people were stabbed , brutalized, they had their eyes plucked out, worms crawling in and out of their bodies. They were tormented by the most horrible demons. Then the Lord said, this class of People knew the truth, they knew the gospel, they knew every of my warnings and what I dislike, but they rather prefer to indulge in secret sins, which they refused to deal with till they die. They thought they kept it very hidden, but they can never keep it from me. They end up here. All those that know the true gospel, but indulged in what one sin, saying I will repent, I will repent will perish in the hottest part of hell , and then the lake of fire. There is no time. Then we went out of hell.

WARNING TO THE CHURCH

The Lord said , let my Church be warned , there is a great diversion and distraction coming, my people must never succumbed to it. Demons are sent from hell by satan to attack and divert all my genuine children who are still standing and serving me. My Church must be careful and watchful to overcome this great diversion. For it will be very tempting, but remember my word in Matthew 24:13. 

( “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”)

    My Church must endured to the end. A great diversion is coming, my true children worldwide must be prepared and ready to overcome. There is no more time. Prayer to overcome the great tribulation must increase. My people must ask for grace to refuse the mark of the beast at all cost. My people must endured to the end. This is not a time for constant battling with secret sin or diverting . The Lord then said, go my son, DO NOT FAIL ME OR YOU WILL ENTER THE HOTTEST PART OF HELL. I am no respecter of person. "

SATAN,S THREAT AND THE LORD,S MIGHTY DELIVERANCE

The Lord tapped me and I opened my eyes. As I closed my eyes to thank the Lord for the revelation,  I was trapped in another dark realm. I felt great darkness, absence of love, great fear and hatred. I felt a void inside me, then I heard a very dark and intimidating voice ;

 "You , if you ever say anything about what that righteous man has shown you, I will eat your mother and your siblings. And then I will kill and drag you to hell. " 

I shouted in a voice I hope was commanding enough,;

" No you Satan, I will speak for the Lord is with me. "

Then the voice said again;

 "you have made your choice."

 Then I saw very fearsome demons, coming towards me with anger and determination to kill me, but then all of a sudden, I was pulled out of that realm. My eyes were now opened in my room, I was shaking with fear. But then I closed my eyes and I saw the Lord in my room, he held me on the shoulder and said;

" Fear not, they are empty threats. I am with you, they cannot harm you."

 Immediately, I felt great peace, love and joy. 

I said Lord ; 
."I am enjoying this feeling, please, do not remove your hand from my shoulder. "

I really felt great the warmth. The Lord said; 
" Son , no time. Write down every thing I have shown you."

I opened my eyes and started writing.

N.B

Read Revelation 22:11-15

God bless you.

Shalom.

8/17/20, 2:16 PM - +233 54 385 8864: My mother graduated in 1965 &
got a teaching job at a Government
College 

The teachers were given car loans
& she bought a brand new Opel
Kadett.

They were to pay back the loan
over 4 years.

However, one of the teachers took
half of the money the others took
as loan...
Bought a fairly used car & got a driver.

So, when other teachers would drive to
school & park their brand new cars, his
driver would drop him off in the
morning & come and pick him at knocking off time.

My mum said they laughed at him,
calling him "Acting Big Man" because
he got a driver...
But he'd just smile.
One day, one of the teachers had cause
to go out of the school during school
hours. He returned to report that he
saw his colleague's driver using his car
as *taxi*

When they "reported" his driver to
him, he said he was aware that was
why he hired a driver...

Why park a car for 6-8 hours, when it
can be making money for you?
The other teachers were stunned:
suddenly, he didn't look as stupid as
they thought!
Now, because of the extra income from
using his car as a taxi, he was able to
pay back the loan in a year...

By the 2nd year, he bought a 2nd car to
add to his taxi fleet.
By the 3rd year, he bought 2 more
taxis!

By the 4th year when my mum & others
finished paying their loans, this guy had 6 taxis.

Then he bought a brand new Opel
Kadett, the newer model!
Other cars were 4 years old...
My mum said, that was the moment
they realised who was smart & who was
foolish among them all.

This happened 1965-1970.
I was born 1968, in the midst of all this.

I was told that story in 1979 when I
entered secondary school

It has remained in my brains since then...

Today, I see too many young folks more
interested in *spending* their money instead of *investing* it, they
 buy the things they don't
need to impress people who don't like
them.

Too many people living fake lives in
these days of social media.

The fake generation buy fake hair, fake nails , list is long -  fake almost everything.

I've seen people pose by cars they don't
own to take pictures & post on social
media.
Young people don't seem to understand
discretion: the competition to out do
each other in the "I've arrived" ranking
is just too much.
My niece, an undergraduate asked me
to buy her a phone...
I asked what type does she want: she
mentioned a type, I checked the price:
$200 USD

Now, I use an Infinix Hot 5 worth maybe $50 USD or less
thereabout, it was even a gift by one
of my site contractors.
But this 20 year old girl wants to use a
$200 USD phone!
Something is definitely wrong
somewhere...!

Seriously, we can't continue like this.

My generation is halfway out.
I am sorry for the younger generation,
those aged 16-30. I honestly don't know
what this world would be like when
they are in their 50s & 60s.
May God's mercy prevail upon them,
may He give them sense.
Amen.

Let me add:
Mike Murdock says,
"A foolish man will enjoy a perfect
today & lose a perfect tomorrow.
A wise man will forfeit a perfect today
to gain a perfect tomorrow.

MATURITY IS THE ABILITY TO DELAY
GRATIFICATION".
Every young person needs to 
understand this!

Enjoy the rest of your *AUGUST*

9/30/20, 5:05 PM - Liva: Ok so guys the info is that we’ll be writing the Physics practicals and according to the lecturers at the lab,they’ve taught the electronics so there’s no way we’re missing out on the physics practical exams
So if you missed the prelab sections,please try and see your colleagues for their notes and do well to read through your practical books

If it’s for a good course like this then bruh I’m in for it cos it honestly doesn’t make any sense sorry to say cos we all can attest to the fact that we did no practical 🤝
9/30/20, 7:59 PM - Liva: Besides we were told there were no tools to perform the experiments in the practical book so I don’t see why we have to pay for something we had no hand in 

If what I’m saying actually makes sense at all 🤷🏿‍♀️

10/7/20, 10:09 AM - Enoch: the duration of the quiz is about 20+ minute and the period to which it can be done is about 8+ hours, that is if the period is given as 2 hours and the duration is 30 minutes, period will be the current time i alert you + 2hours (alert =10:00+2hour =>12:00 ), you can do the quiz within any time between 10:00 to 12:00, but you stop within 30minutes

The quiz is going to be on Monday.
It's going to be Coding in c .
I will share a sample algorithms with which we will try to implement in c programming language.
Similar algorithms will be given in the quiz to be implemented in c.

The lecturer said provided he does not change his mind the second quiz(10 questions) will be added to the final exam totalling 60 (multiple choice questions and others) based on some algorithms

Thank you.

From the Office of the High Priest of the Great Atlantic Hall Sacred Choir, we bring greetings to all as this is the final lap of the '19/20 second semester academic year. 🙏

"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts." ~ Winston S. Churchill 🤓

It may be tiring and difficult now, but you’ll look back and realize just how far you’ve come. We want to let you know that we are thinking of you and reminding you not to give up. We know that you can do it! 💪

Just keep in mind that every exam you take is an opportunity to showcase your skills and learn something new. You’ve been so dedicated and it’s sure to pay off. 🙃

"The road to success and the road to failure are almost exactly the same." ~ Colin R. Davis 🤥

Give it your best, then give it a rest. You deserve it. You have been stressed as you prepared for this exam, but your work will pay off, and you’ll soon be blessed. 😇

You’re such a diligent and conscientious student, and we know that you’ll make us extremely proud. Wishing you lots of luck throughout your exams. Take a deep breathe, and do not let your nerves get the best of you. Keep trusting in the process. ✊

All the best for your exams. We all have the utmost faith in you and know that you’ll achieve every single one of your goals. Always remember, the Almighty Atlantic Kofi Busummuru will continue to be your guide through this period. 🙇🏻‍♂️

On this note, we wish all continuing students success in their examinations. 💙

May Busummuru forever be your guide 💀

*Former UCC SRC PRO And FillaHQ Reporter Picked Up*

The entirety of FillaHQ wishes to inform and confirm to all its cherished friends that one of it's staunch reporters and immediate past Public Relation Officer of the Univeristy of Cape Coast's Student Representative Council, Osei Agyemang commonly known as Filla Fidel has been picked up by security personnel. 

According to an account received, Fidel immediately after writing an exams at 5pm today was confronted by campus security personnel asking he followed them to provide assistance in their investigations towards an alleged robbery on campus earlier this week. Unbeknownst to Fidel, these security personnel whisked him to the Central Regional Police Command where he is said to have been charged for 'Spreading False Info and Causing Fear Panic' in connection to the robbery news that made waves nationally this week. 

This may not be surprising as earlier this week, a notion was out that Fidel putting out such a publication was for Political expediency and thus he will face authorities.

Interestingly, Mr. Osei Agyemang himself about a month ago was a victim of a near robbery attack on campus, an incident that got him severely injuring his foot and seeking treatment at the University of Cape Coast Hospital (which records can attest). An obvious reason why he used this publication to bring to bare the gravity of the situation at hand following the rumours of a robbery this week. 

Fidel who is said to have two exams scheduled for tomorrow, 16th October 2020, is currently at the Baakano Police station with frantic efforts being made to get him back on campus to take these papers. 

In that regard, FillaHQ pleads with all of its cherished friends to keep  calm and also pleads with all students who have information or were affected by the 'possible' robbery attack that was reported to reach out to us so as to bring closure and clarity to this matter.

In the mean time we would humbly ask all students and friends join us on all social media platforms as we say *#FreeFIDEL*

FillaHQ will keep you informed on any new update as always.


*Signed: FillaHQ Team*

*FillaHQ... Getting informed is a right*

 *You have been robbed by armed robbers as a student on campus and yet you are hiding behind the iron-curtain of "it will get to nowhere" so you have decided not to speak on the matter. This is the right time to speak if you are a victim of such robbery cases on campus. We can't remain cowards forever. Dont only say "free Fidel". Come out and speak if you are a victim.*

#FreeFidelNow✊🏿


💙. Finally Ogyanframa news will like to thank Sir John,  The Barrister, Topher, Cathode and all student leaders who have been there to visit Fidel and also gave him words of hope that the student body is with him.  Your efforts are deeply appreciated🙏🏾

*UCC never again*

*#FreeFidel*
*Ogyanframa News.*
*Stay tuned for more information*

Don't keep on checking cause the marks are made based on your errors. And also don't think you are right so you won't click the check button or else you will get zero

10/23/20, 8:59 AM - Liva: The exams comes in two parts which is section A and B
We answer all questions in section A and one from section B
Know the numbers associated with the resistor color bands and how to calculate them
We will be drawing a linear graph in the section B(Marks are allocated for well labeled graphs,complete table,axis labeling and any relevant information provided on the graph).
Know the precautions associated with performing the various experiments 
Also know the parts of the oscilloscope and what each part does and also the uses of an oscilloscope and how to connect a diode in forward and reverse biase mode

Basically that’s all you need to know
10/23/20, 9:01 AM - +233 54 216 4852: Ebeyere

10/23/20, 9:05 AM - Liva: With the resistor color bands,we may or may not be given the table of information so you must know each and every information associated with each color band
For example:If your first color band is black,black is 0 on the table,brown is 1,red is 2 and so on 

You can get this info on the page before experiment 1 of the practical book

10/25/20, 10:21 AM - +233 54 400 0950: *A Letter To The Uninspired Youth*

*By Tsifodze Kwadzo Ernest*

I posted a quote that said, “Don’t work 8 hours for a company then go home and not work on your own goals. You’re not tired, you’re uninspired”. Many were able to relate this to themselves. However, I wrote this letter to just to help one person in getting to know why he is still uninspired and help him know the way forward.

One of the main goals of this generation is to make money. Many of the youth have deployed a lot of ways and tactics without paying much attention to the process to make money. Some think once you make money, you will be comfortable and happy in this life. Everyone is chasing pleasure and a life embroidered by hedonistic values.

Well, I want you to read this now to understand that money doesn’t give value to your life. We must rethink of our lives. The kind of deep satisfaction you need can’t be given to you by money. What you really need is a deep belief that you matter, that you are beautiful, and that you count. Once you believe in this, you have to find your gifts and talent.

We have to commit ourselves in becoming a person of value. People are afraid of losing their jobs than their gifts. Yes! I know you need your job to survive, but why are you not working on your goals, dreams and gifts? Your job is never a guarantee in this life. You can be sacked; the company can collapse at any time.

What will become of you when you are fired from your job? This question is actually the frustration of many. The greatest challenge you have is that you haven’t decided to commit to yourself and work on your goals and dream. You didn’t come to this world with a job, but you came with a gift.

Your gift is what will bring you value. But the choice to develop it is with you.

“You have brains in your head

You have feet in your shoes

You can steer yourself any

Direction you choose.”- Dr Seuss

Go to work in the morning and in the evening find something to do that will improve your life or work on your goals. I must admit Life is simple, just focus on your gift and develop it so well that you can’t be rejected ever.

You don’t need to leave your job. But do that once you have fully developed your gifts and talent. Always remember this “Your job is paying you to develop your gift once you are done developing them, you decide how much you want to earn with your gifts”

You have the responsibility to make your nation better. Find value through your gifts and talents- money will follow.

It is well

10/26/20, 9:24 PM - +233 27 426 7039: The prime reason of the CITSA telegram platform is to purport the agenda of bringing all and sundry under one roof. That will comprise both the IT & Comp. Science.

Secondly, to avail the semester resources from ( 100 - 400) with ease.

And to conduct on there our online meetings mostly.

12/11/20, 12:35 AM - +233 55 105 2663: Manasseh Azure Awuni: Letter to President-elect Akufo-Addo
Source: Manasseh Azure Awuni  
  10 December 2020 1:33pm



Dear President-elect Nana Akufo-Addo,

I write to congratulate you on winning the 2020 presidential election.

I was excited and hopeful when you first won the election in 2016. Unfortunately, I don’t feel the same way about this victory. I’m ambivalent about your second term, and the reasons are not difficult to find.

In your first term, you knew you would come back to seek our votes, yet the kind of governance you gave us was unimpressive, to say the least. You practically called our bluff.


 
In 2024, you will not need our votes. Some of your appointees have their political umbilical cords are tied to your presidency.

They know that even if the NPP wins in the next election, they will have no chance of landing lucrative jobs. For such people, there is a lot of motivation to loot as much as they can and retire or venture into something else.

For this reason, your second term can get worse than we saw in the first term.

But it can also get better, Mr. President. Your second term can get better if you care about your legacy.

Since the days of your predecessor, I have always maintained that any idiot can borrow money to build hospitals or pay fees, especially when there is always an avenue to pocket a chunk of it. One does not need to be a genius of a leader to do that.

What a true leader does is to inspire hope by creating a society of meritocracy, by creating and atmosphere that rewards the ingenuity, creativity and hard work of its citizens, and by taking decisions that are in the national interest but may not be pleasing to his party and sycophants.

So your second term can get better if you pay attention to the fact that a wealthy country such as ours is very miserable because its resources are stolen and hoarded by a select few while our youth see every sunrise as a painful reminder of their hopelessness.

It can get better if you impersonate a bit of the no-nonsense disposition of the Nana Akufo-Addo of yore, and employ that against those destroying the country under your watch.

Your second term will get better if you become the Akufo-Addo we thought we knew, and not the President Akufo-Addo we know. And your hands are freer now to be your true self than when you had another election before you.

For a president seeking re-election, acting tough against delinquent and influential appointees is like killing the tsetse fly that perches on the scrotum.
But now, you’re free from those threats and political blackmail.

So let’s see a bit of the Akufo-Addo that was marketed to us in 2016. Let us see the Akufo-Addo who is a believer of the rule of law, not one that believes and promotes the rule of thuggery; an Akufo-Addo who believes in press freedom, and not one that believes only in press freedom favourable to him.

And finally, let us see a new NPP under your leadership. Let us see the democratic and civilised NPP of old, the one that was attractive to intellectuals but still maintained its core base.

Let us see the NPP that gives men and women of valour and principles a chance, and not one that has been hijacked rogues and questionable characters because of their dubious wealth.

If you remember my “Ogyam” epistle, I said you were becoming stronger, but the party was becoming weaker.

A party founded on the core principles of democracy and good governance should not be using “North Korean” principles in dealing with and eliminating candidates who want to either lead the party or contest for parliament because they are not the favourites of a few.

In this election, the NPP voters have shown the party “a little bit of Atiwa” and I hope you and the party will pick some useful lessons from there.

I wish you good luck and pledge my unalloyed support to make your second term a success. I intend to support you not by joining the innumerable courtiers of paid and unpaid praise-singers of the administration.

Like the charge given to the Prophet of God in Ezekiel 3:17, I intend to point out to you what’s going wrong. But if you do things worthy of praise and defending, I will not withhold that from you as I have done in the past.

God bless you and bless our Homeland Ghana.

Yours sincerely,

Manasseh Azure Awuni

The project is aimed at empowering graduates of UCC and, potentially, other educational and business institutions to be capable of sustainably implementing practice-oriented information and communication technologies (ICT) qualification programmes with the ultimate goal of promoting graduate employability or entrepreneurship. The Foundation is presently conducting need analyses and compiling a proposal for capacity building for ICT teaching staff of UCC and you have been identified as an important stakeholder. We would therefore be grateful if you could share your insights and perspectives with us via the following questionnaire. Please note that all feedback will be treated as anonymous and confidential.

3/8/21, 12:45 PM - +233 20 786 7481: What is programming?

Programming is basically a *communication* between you (programmer) and a computer. 

The computer understands only one language known as binaries (E.g 0110011). 
It is hard for human beings to communicate with the computer using binaries....

Human beings had to introduce a language which can be used to communicate with the computer aside *binaries*
These languages are termed *programming languages* and example include C++, java, python...

Since the computer understands only one language known as binaries, a *tool* known as *compiler or interpreter* was introduced...

A *compiler or interpreter* is a tool that converts human readable languages (programming languages) into a language (binaries) that a computer can understand.

In the communication between you (programmer) and the computer, you send *a set of instructions* to the computer and the computer *carries out those instructions*...

The set of instructions is termed as a *program*

The carrying out of instructions by the computer is termed as *execution*

The language used for the communication is termed as *programming language*

*a compiler or interpreter* is required to convert the programming language into binaries (a language the computer understands)...

My name is *melbay guy* and I'm inviting u to my 2 days master class coming off @ de end of this week...

*The goal of the class is to give u a good foundation and understanding of programming from C++ perspective*

C++ is a programming language that can be used to build systems such as:
-hotel, school, library, restaurant, etc management systems
-games
-robots and machines
-etc...

*come and grab the foundation of programming so u can set off to explore the world of programming by yourself☺️☺️☺️*

❗❗the fee for de 2 days class is ghc 10...

Interested learners shld follow de link below to join de watsapp group where u can find more information about the meetings... 💻💻💻💻💻💻💻

Sule was a very dull boy. His peers called him "Father of fools"

When he was in a Private school he got the following results:

Maths = 2%
English = 5%
Science = 0%
Social sciences = 1%

He was taken to a government school and got the following results;

Maths = 0%
English = 1%
Science = 0%
Social sciences = 0%

His parents were very disappointed but still decided to put him in a Christian school even though they were not Christians.
The First term Sule passed and was the  first in the class . 
Maths = 90%
English = 93%
Science = 95%
Social sciences = 89%

His parents could not believe it. They asked him how he managed to pass and he said;

*"when I saw  a man nailed on the cross at every corner of the school building, I knew that these teachers don't joke with students here, they will nail me too if I fail''*

😂😂😂
 _*The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.*_🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.

 *JOB  SCAM  ALERT.* 

*There is no JOB RECRUITMENT IN CÔTE DIVOIRE*

If anyone tells you there is a work vacancy at *DHL* which you would have to travel to *Cote divoire* and also to work at france or *Dubai* but would have to pass through *Côte dvoire,* is a big Lie. 
An organisation known as *Q.Net* *(Côte dvoire branch)* are the People behind this fracas and what they do is lie to people here in *Ghana🇬🇭 and other neighbouring* countries that there is a job *vacancy* at *DHL in *Cote dvoire* and with that, travelling papers are to be done in *Cote Divoire* and for accommodation and feeding, you need to come along with an amount of *7000 Ghana cedis.* Once you get to Cote d'ivoire there's *no return.* You will be camped and forced to deceive your *close friends and family using the same said procedure* to get them also there. Once you refuse to do so, your phone will be taken from you and start a chat with your close friends and family about the work.

 *They use the friends and family circle because it's very easy and fast to get the trust of close friends and family.* Once you fall victim and you get there you will also be forced to bring people.

Beware you all out there 

_Please help share to Save a friend, relative or a loved one from this fraudulent activity._ *HAVE A BLESSED DAY AND GOD BLESS YOU.🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽*

I agree with the idea of supplementary plus   a possible reschedule to allow us prep adequately for the quiz

Amaka was the prettiest girl in my class while in primary two.
She was loved by everyone including teachers and students alike. Everyone wanted to be her friend and I wasn't an exception. I used to pray for the day she would borrow sharpener from me so that I could have the opportunity to talk to her but she never borrowed anything from me because she had lots of whatever she wanted.
One day, the names of noisemakers was written by the assistant class monitor who was a girl and didn't like Amaka like the rest of us, so she wrote Amaka's name.
My name was in it too.
When it was time for us to be flogged, the teacher said he was giving us three strokes each. Even though I had a phobia for 'koboko', I decided to do 'odeshi' for my three strokes because I didn't want Amaka to see me cry. After my three lashes, I went to my seat. It was from there I saw my pretty Amaka shivering out out fear. She was already crying even though it wasn't her turn to be flogged. My heart melted for her.
Finally, her turn came.
As the teacher was about to cane her, I stood up from my seat and shouted, 'Uncle I will collect the cane for her!'
The whole class became quiet. Everyone's mouth was opened. The teacher turned to me and asked, "what did you say?"
I replied again, "I want to collect the cane for her".
I saw the look on Amaka's face. She was surprised. I felt like a savior and wanted to use this moment to show her that I can go any length to get her attention. I was ready to sacrifice my little bumbum.
"Come outside!", he commanded me, as he asked Amaka to go back to her seat.
The tempo of my heartbeat increased. Everyone's gaze was fixed on me and the teacher.
As I got to where he was, he muttered something like 'stupid boy, I will show you today' and grabbed me by the front part of my shorts thereby making my bumbum very visible and smooth and even revealing the lines of the panties I wore. I knew I was in trouble because he didn't hold anybody's shorts this way.
I was still feeling the pain from the one I received for myself and now I was about to collect for Amaka. I didn't bother, at least, Amaka will be my friend after now and she will borrow my cleaner and sharpener henceforth.
The first stroke landed on me and it felt like a cutlass was used to divide my yansh!
I screamed with pain as I tried to escape from the teacher's grip but he was way bigger than me so I couldn't escape.
The second stroke came, fiam!
This time around, I knew I was going to die in this man's hand. The whole class felt for me. I tried to look at Amaka's face and that was when I saw her laughing at me. My heart broke like the screen of a Tecno phone. See the person I'm suffering for laughing at me when others were pitying me.
The third one came gbam! and landed on the same place that the other ones landed!
I thought that was all since it was three strokes each, but the teacher didn't let me go.
I ended up receiving 6 hefty strokes for Amaka!
As he let me go, I staggered and fell down. It was as if I was paralyzed.
Somehow, I managed to get to my seat.
Everyone was telling me sorry and it made me cry the more.
I expected Amaka to be the first person to come and tell me sorry but she never came.
After closing hours, I was going to meet her and talk to her when I saw her talking to another boy from my class.
"Amaka how are you?" I asked her. She looked at me and burst into the loud laugher with the other boy.
I began to cry again. I felt betrayed!
That day, I concluded that she was a witch because no normal person would do what she did to me. I was left with many questions. How could she not sympathise with me after all I did? Not even a small accolade. I was devastated!
Today's lesson is simple!
1. Not everyone you sacrifice for, will appreciate you. Some people are born ingrates.
2. Never inherit another man's problems in the name of helping them. That's foolishness.
3. Never inherit another man's enemy in the name of trying to be loyal! The enemy may deal with you more than they dealt with the person!
4. Never try to force someone into loving you, let it happen naturally else your efforts may end up in tears!
5. I called her a witch because I couldn't get her to like me.
Because you can't have something doesn't mean you should call it bad. That you're poor, does not make money bad. That you can't afford an iPhone doesnt mean you should start beefing those who own it. Lol
The following day at school, her name was written again as a noisemaker but mine wasn't written because I had not even recovered from the strokes of the previous day, so I didn't have the power to make noise.
As it got to her turn to be flogged, the teacher paused and said, "where is that your husband that collected cane for you yesterday?"
As she pointed to me, I wanted to invoke the gods of my forefathers on her but didn't know to reach them so I just gave her that Patience Nzokwu kind of evil eyes until the teacher then asked me, "are you not collecting for her today?"
As I nodded my head to say no, tears flowed down my small cheeks when i remembered the previous day, but that didn't block my view from seeing Amaka cry as the Uncle unleashed six sweet strokes on her buttocks and I clapped for him from where I was seated!
That was the day I knew My God is indeed a God of vengeance! 
Good morning 🌄 family.

4/7/21, 7:50 PM - Reuben: 35 + bonus (5)😊

T for Thanks.

Good evening dear ones. 
I wish you the best in your Exams tomorrow morning. 
1. Go to the centre like a soldier fully prepared to conquer anything that will come his/her way. 

2. Also remember that, you can get the grade you want from tomorrow's paper.

3. Agenda 60/60 ✊. You can do it, I trust you guys. 

4. If you forget anything, relax, breath in and out, pray to God, and get back to it or tackle another question. 


The best is my wish for you 💓

7/14/21, 7:24 AM - +233 24 676 6564: Disadvantages of Web Server

1. Cost

The expenses involved in a web server is far more greater compared to an electronic web hosting method. Always a local web server is equipped with monthly costs which is usually expensive. Depending on the type of resources and the infrastructure, the price varies.


2. Security

Using web servers also brings many security concerns. Some of the web servers allow HTTP traffic rather than HTTPS. The transactions that is taking place through the HTTP is known to undergo a process known as network packet sniffing.


3. Convenience

The convenience of web servers depends on the type of website you are using. It will be convenient as far as the website is an online enterprise. Most web servers doesn't seem to work well for websites with customized design and style. In that case the only option will be using a clustered web hosting machine.


4. Web Reference

The contents on the web is edited frequently. As a result, it becomes impossible for the web servers to work without an internet access. Sometimes the references that is available on a webpage will be disappeared once the page is closed.


5. Traffic Congestion

In some instances, there can be hardware failures, software errors, updates or maintenances in the web server which causes partial availability of it. As a result, all the remaining web servers undergo traffic congestion. Which means that the web server receives more traffic than normal.

Guys, the semester is very short and Boss Prince needs time to also concentrate more on his academic stuffs since this will be his last semester. The Alpha tutorials team has come out with the new idea that this semester's Saturday tutorials will be a paid one so that the instructor will feel motivated to deliver. It is GHs 50 per head. If you are interested, you can dm Ike on to register. Thank you

Please someone called me  telling me he was doing some registration online and he mistakenly put my number on what he was registering, that my number is similar to his number and that the password of what he was registering was sent to my phone which I actually saw as 6310. He was now appealing to me to give him the reset code that was sent to my phone so that he could finish his registration. I told him to call me with the number he claimed was similar to mine so that I could verify his claim, he told me he didn't have credit in that line.

I got online to find out more, only to discover he was actually trying to reset my bank online/yahoomail password and that he is a fraudster, an account hacker and also a 419er. If I had given him the code which was sent to my phone, he would have used it to reset my bank online/mobile app account.

Please let us be careful and vigilant. Fraudsters are devising new ways every day. This is a new way of defrauding people...

Share to prevent others from being defrauded. I care............pls beware sent as received.

FIX UCC ACCOMMODATION NOW‼️FIX UCC ACCOMMODATION NOW‼️‼️
FIX UCC ACCOMMODATION NOW‼️‼️‼️
I write with much pains and anger..Yes am angry and All  concerned Students are angry...Yes, We have every right to be angry..
The Rate Of Accommodation Fee is alarming📍So extravagant !! This is a clear extortion of Students by Hostel Managers in and outside UCC Campuses..
*SUBJECT MATTER SUPRA AND ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS*
1) Is the UCC SRC Awake..?
3)Has there be any steps at all..!
2)By Which Laws , which authority do these Managers Operate..?
3) What is the terms and Conditions Of the Rent Control Concerning Students Hostels Affairs..?
4) How is the comfort and Safety Of Students in these extravagant fee Hostels..."I Mean Very Mismatched "
*And many questions You may like to add...*
This is an act Of barbaric.. Day light Robbery..
UCC students say " We Are Bleeding "
*Enough.. Is Enough...*
We call On the SRC and The School Management to take an Immediate Step‼️‼️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥

Hey fam can we all do this to save ourselves some stress and buy some time for us to finish this assignment.

Honestly it’s a lot of work and the time given is short.

So I suggest we all go on the elearning platform and request for an extension of the submission deadline.

I understand some groups are done but for the sake of everyone let’s all come together and do this please 🙏🏿😕

8/2/21, 6:05 PM - +233 20 010 1379: STRIKE ACTIONS : UNIVERSITY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OF GHANA ( UTAG ) AND SENIOR STAFF ASSOCIATION- UNIVERSITIES OF GHANA ( SSA-UoG ) MUST RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AND CONTINUE WITH NEGOTIATIONS BUT GOVERNMENT MUST ACT SWIFTLY IN THEIR RESPONSE TO THEIR DEMANDS – NATIONAL UNION OF GHANA STUDENTS ( NUGS ) ADVICES PARTIES

1. With reference to the press release dated 28th and 30th July 2021, from both the University Teachers Association Of Ghana ( UTAG ) and SeniorStaff Association – Universities of Ghana ( SSA-UoG ) respectively, registering their displeasure towards government’s continuous delay in honouring the full terms of their negotiations.

2.Both UTAG and SSA-UoG states emphatically in their releases that the government has always failed to respect the Rules of Engagement agreed by both parties to guide the negotiations resulting to an indefinite suspension slated for Monday, 2nd of August 2021.

3. The National Union of Ghana Students appreciates UTAG and SSA-UoG for the patience and sacrifice of their membership towards service rendered to Ghanaian students and the nation at large. We believe strongly that the answers UTAG and SSA-UoG are seeking from the government are for the right reasons.

4. That notwithstanding, We disagree with the strike approach considering its effect on students, especially within the abnormal times we find ourselves in and the earlier obstruction of academic work by the global shutdown. UTAG and SSA-UoG must as an act of good faith towards students and government avoid an entrenched position in all dialogues to address their concerns.

5. We call on government to;

I. Respect all the Rules of Engagement agreed upon by parties

II.Reach a compromise which will satisfy all parties as soon as possible.

6. We appeal to our lecturers to stay in the classroom for the sake of the future generation as they continue to negotiate with the appropriate quarters since Ghanaian students shouldn’t always be at the receiving end.

6. We implore all students to remain calm as the Union engages all parties involved for an amicable resolution.

*We won’t call off our strike – UTAG*
Jonas NyaborbyJonas Nyabor   August 6, 2021  Reading Time: 2 mins read

Members of the University Teachers Association of Ghana (UTAG) across the country have resolved not to return to the lecture halls until the government addresses the Union’s concerns.

The leadership of UTAG at the various public Universities have been meeting their members to communicate the outcome of its meeting with the government.

At one of such meetings at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, UTAG members remained resolute and said they will not call off the ongoing strike.

The President of UTAG, Professor Charles Marfo, told Citi News that members of the association have asked for the strike to continue until their demands are met.

“In our last meeting with the government, it didn’t end well. It ended in a stalemate… We needed to sit down with them and tell them what has happened. We also needed to ask them about the way forward. One of the clear things that came out is that they [members] think that we should continue with the strike until government begins to pay good attention to our needs and concerns…. I understand UEW, GIJ, UDS, UENR, UHAS have said we should continue the strike and once we are all saying the same thing, we believe the government has to sit down with us and talk,” he said.

Amidst rumours that the government had secured an injunction to stop the strike, Prof. Marfo said UTAG has not received any such official document.

He stressed that UTAG’s members are extremely disgruntled about the government’s treatment, and although they are not enthused to stay home, they believe that they need to fight for better conditions of service for themselves.

“People are not happy at all, considering where we used to be in 2012 and how much our salaries have fallen. We plead with the public to understand what the situation is. No lecturer is interested in going on strike, but if push comes to shove and there is no option but to strike, then we have to go on strike.”

Mr. Oko bought a well from Alhaji Adongo, and paid in full.
The next day, Adongo came to meet Mr. Oko at his shop.

OKO: Ah, Alhaji, welcome. I hope no problem o.

ALHAJI: There is no problem, Mr. Oko. I just came to tell you that I sold you the well, but not the water inside the well. If you fetch water from the well, you will pay me.

OKO: Ah, Alhaji, I am very happy you came. In fact, I was just about to come and meet you. I don't need the water in the well, I want to use the well to store some of my goods. So, I want you to come and carry all your water from the well so that water will not spoil my goods.. If you don't carry your water by tomorrow, I will start charging you rent for using my well to store your water... 

Neighbours are still trying to revive Alhaji Adongo..😅😅😅

9/14/21, 7:32 AM - +233 24 779 7704: Please Enoch, how can madam fix the quiz at 10:30am for us?
You know very well that if a lecturer is not using his or her period for a quiz, then the time should be set up by both parties. 
Assuming Dr EE wanted to discuss something with us at 10:30am so what would've happened?

My appeal is that going forward, we don't need to allow any lecturer to dictate everything to us without considering that we're equally important parties he or she should consult first. 

We're in level 300 now, so let's behave as such. That fear of victimization should be stopped by now.
Thank you for your endless efforts all the time.

*Hello guys, I want to suggest that looking at the voting trend, one of the candidates(Vice president position) should sacrifice his/her  aspiration to the other. If not we're going to lose all the positions.*

Elections are won if you put out right strategies.

*Those candidates should contact each other as early as possible and issues a formal statement on this platform and also call other supporters from different platforms to adhere to that decision*

Thank you

Good evening please, 
I want to take a few minutes of your time to draw your attention to something, we have been a family ever since we all came to campus and joined this group, due to my inability to express my grief I have been mute about a lot of stuff. To put it simply a few of our brothers and sisters here have lost someone very dear to them, on behalf of the class I want to apologize for not being with you during  your time of pain, we humbly extend our condolences to you all who have lost someone in the past 2 years up until now, it is with deep regret that we say we are sorry 🙏🏿. 

A brother to us has lost his Mother, and on behalf of us all I extend my condolences for your lost and ask that you stay strong.  The brother whom I speak of is Rockson, please give him some words of encouragement when you see him and let him know we are there for him as he has allowed me to make this known to the entire class, Once again stay strong🙏🏿.

❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️
9/21/21, 10:55 PM - +233 20 010 1379: Please take time to go through 🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿.

With internet to our disposal, you can practically learn anything online.

Did you know some group of people have made an open source curricula of computer science & other fields online.

I'll share that after this, back to interest look for job ads & look for the skills they require so you build on it. *The paper(cert)* opens doors but will keep you in the room is your skill which usually is done by you.

9/25/21, 8:58 PM - +233 23 240 3912: I think the fisheries and aquatics people have no problem, might be because we're close to the sea though
9/25/21, 9:02 PM - +233 20 010 1379: If you remember correctly, when we came to campus we were the first to complain about we not doing python but the physics department did, when we forwarded this to the lecturers what happened, we can all see it now that it has been added and it's been thought
9/25/21, 9:03 PM - +233 23 240 3912: We're doing python?
9/25/21, 9:05 PM - +233 20 010 1379: It takes five year to be able to change an academic policy, we might not benefit from pointing these things out but those who come before us will benefit of it,
@233269160808 if am not mistaken you made this statement way back then.😊
9/25/21, 9:05 PM - +233 24 779 7704: Please don't defend the department. We know every department has a problem but ours is too bad.
9/25/21, 9:05 PM - +233 20 010 1379: Data structures
9/25/21, 9:05 PM - +233 20 010 1379: But the 100 are doing it official
9/25/21, 9:06 PM - +233 20 010 1379: Please finish reading,
To what end am I defending the department, am only setting the fact on the ground straight
9/25/21, 9:09 PM - +233 24 779 7704: It's not about adding python to our courses that matters, how it is been taught matters. 

They'll hire lecturers who cannot do the work to come and handle us at the end of the day we will benefit nothing.
9/25/21, 9:10 PM - +233 55 136 8074: Preach bro😌
9/25/21, 9:12 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Ah that 😂
9/25/21, 9:13 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Okay, good for them 👌🏽
9/25/21, 9:14 PM - +233 24 171 6342: @233554317909 is only trying to say the department is trying to make changes but the changes be slow. Probably because of a financial constraint.
We may not benefit from it much but its a start🤷🏽‍♂️
9/25/21, 9:20 PM - +233 24 779 7704: They're certain things that can be changed without necessarily money. 
We d students need to advocate for those changes.
As for change, it will happen but there must be a push by we the beneficiaries.
9/25/21, 9:21 PM - +233 24 171 6342: For example
9/25/21, 9:22 PM - +233 24 779 7704: The work rate of part time lecturers

11/3/21, 10:39 PM - +233 24 779 7704: Applications open for Cardano’s  5th Haskell Course in Accra, Ghana Input-Output Global (IOG) (the engineering company behind Cardano)  one of the world's pre-eminent blockchain engineering companies, will partner with Pan-African Tech Foundation (PATF) to run this course in Accra.

Applicants interested in this course can access the application forms via https://www.p-atf.org/cardanohaskellcourse   and use the password  I3l0kCh4iN   to gain access. This course is free. The application process commenced on the 1st of November, 2021. 80 candidates will be shortlisted by 10th December. The course will commence on 10th January 2022, and it will last 9 weeks.

The course outline will include 4 weeks of training on Haskell programming language and 4 weeks of the Plutus Pioneer Program. The training structure and the training material will be developed by Dr Lars Brünjes. Dr Brünjes holds a PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Regensburg in Germany. 

The training will include smart contract programming with Plutus, a programming language developed specifically for smart contracts by IOG (Plutus Pioneer Program) and functional programming with Haskell. Functional programming is defined as the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects. Traditional languages like Java and Python are adopting functional programming principles as it is great for in-demand tasks such as data analysis and machine learning. 

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. It is heavily used in FinTech due to its security, transparency, and accuracy without compromising on credibility and reducing regulatory costs. This training will allow students to work on real-life programming experience and smart contract applications.

The Haskell course has been successfully run in Athens, Greece, then in Barbados in association with the University of West Indies; in Ethiopia in co-operation with the Ethiopian Ministry of Innovation and Technology, and the Ugandan Government. With the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, IOG runs an online learning course with Haskell in Mongolia.

1/24/22, 9:51 AM - Liva: Good morning everyone. Hope we're all doing well? So it's rather unfortunate to announce that the year isn't going well for some of us.I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I have no choice. A brother amongst us who goes by the name Samuel Okyere Wai recently lost his elder brother and I would like us all to support he nd his family with whatever little amount we have to support he and his family in this hard time. So if you're willing to support please do send your contribution to my momo number-0553763443 with the name Godliver Alangyam. Thank you and do have a great day😌
1/24/22, 9:53 AM - Liva: I also do understand that some of you might be wondering why we are doing this for the loss of his brother but the truth is we couldn't do anything for him when he lost his dad back in level 100 so at least let's try and do this for him.

1/24/22, 11:06 PM - +233 57 043 8993: Is there a deadline?
1/24/22, 11:12 PM - Liva: The funeral is this week and I want to send the money to him before the funeral day
1/24/22, 11:12 PM - +233 57 043 8993: Ohokay 🙏🏿
1/25/22, 9:20 AM - +233 24 506 5954: I beleave he can still make use of the money even after the funeral.
So I suggest u don't put the deadline so short, someone might not be able to contribute b4 the deadline but, could be able to do so after.
The amount might even be encouraging then than now🙏🏻🙏🏻
1/25/22, 9:31 AM - +233 24 101 9797: I agree
1/25/22, 11:16 AM - Liva: Ok guys I totally understand where y’all are coming from but let’s not forget that in as much as I’m making time out this week to do this, I equally have a lot of things going on that need attention too.
Truth is even if I give y’all up to the end of the year saf, most of you will still not send anything neither would the amount you plan to send change and that is the complete truth so let’s be realistic.

The more you postpone things, the more excuse people get to tell you “Oh I forgot” when actually they haven’t and they’ll just keep giving excuses till God knows when.
1/25/22, 11:20 AM - +233 20 010 1379: There's also no problem given him additional support after, monies that come after the deadline will still do.😊

Please oo look at something  here oo, project work and group assignment are very different one, take a look at how Dr. Alimatu grouped us randomly and the result of such grouping, some members will be very reluctant while others do the work. I believe we should pair up according to our own strengths.

Remember max of 3.
Deadline Friday.

Note that it's only the grouping, a project supervisor will be assigned to you and give a topic for the project. 

Thank you.

1/27/22, 10:58 AM - Liva: Good morning to all😊

Hope you’re all doing well?

So this is the little I have to say with regards to the groupings.

Truth is I have worked with y’all in one way or the other and I must say you each are unique in your own way.Don’t let laziness make you feel or think you’re not good enough for something.

If you would brush off the laziness,halt certain things or people that take up much of your time and attention, you’ll realize how unique you are.Also put aside all those perceptions you have about others not being good and what not because truth is they are but you just don’t know it yet😊

This is the little I have to say.Hope it helps you in making the right decisions 🤗

Any last addition.
Note: you can do your project alone as well.



Unlike quiz and examination, you can get assistance from others, its allowed (I can attest to that, I have been in a number of them so far), all that is required is that you understand and can defend your project that's all.

Am willing and available to provide assistance if need and am sure we can work in groups and at the same time as a class to help each other.

I will be submitting the list @ 1:20pm that's all the time I can buy for you. Thank you

A video of how ATMs work
You can watch from minute 2:14 if you just want to know about the transaction process
3/1/22, 3:49 PM - +233 55 105 2663: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the buzzwords of the moment. In financial institutions, there is a lot of focus on emerging technologies, things like chatbots and intelligent processes.


But how do AI and Machine Learning apply to the ATM space, and how can they be used to make advancements?

Here at Renovite we are continuously looking at the data generated by ATMs and reflecting on what it could be used for – and how. One thing that AI is good at is determining ‘what is normal?’ and this is a key element for the operability of ATMs.

Some examples of models that have been built include:


The ability to predict if the rate of cash being withdrawn equals what the cash management system predicted – i.e. will the ATM run out of cash? Many things can impact this. For example, if a nearby competing ATM fails, is that generating more traffic? Is the weather an influence on this ATM? Are the smaller denomination notes available on this ATM, if not, is this causing larger withdrawal amounts? These factors, together with predicting future values, is what machine learning excels at.
 
Should we be seeing transactions from a particular ATM? It may be communicating fine, but is there a reason the ATM isn’t being used? My favourite example of when this happens is when various creatures i.e. snakes, rodents and other none-welcoming species move in and scare away customers. The lack of transactions when transactions are expected is a key part of identifying an occurrence like this and ensuring the efficiency of the monitoring process.
 
Another use of AI is controlling the customer experience. Because AI algorithms will tend to store sequences of data and history, this can be used for recommendation engines at the ATM. We could use this in the ATM experience to target advertising messages – ensuring the adverts which get the best results are targeted towards customers. We are also reviewing how using AI can be used to create custom experiences for every customer based on the behaviour at ATMs.
 
In Canada, the SickKids hospital is famous for using the data from health monitors together with AI techniques to predict when children are likely to have a life-threatening event, so staff can be alerted in advance. We use ATM logs to do the same thing for ATMs, capturing this data, and predicting when intervention may be required. For example, predicting card reader failure, electronic PIN pad or any other errors in the electromechanical parts in the cash dispensing process.
The examples above are just scratching the surface. Capturing and using data is just the first step, but in the age of cloud and on-demand processing power, harnessing and using the data is the first step in providing game-changing technology to continuously improve the profitability of ATM estates.

3/1/22, 3:52 PM - +233 23 240 3912: This talks of how AI "can" be used in ATM. Thus making it an AI automation
3/1/22, 4:00 PM - +233 55 105 2663: Please, what is the current state of Russia?
3/1/22, 4:02 PM - +233 23 240 3912: Your question is unclear...
3/1/22, 4:05 PM - +233 20 010 1379: The key word you @233540389039  are missing is intelligence. If any system gains intelligence it becomes an AI else it's not, therefore an ATM is not an AI system to any extent or else we would also say a traffic light is an AI system.

3/7/22, 8:27 AM - +233 23 240 3912: We don't prefer shit, he should stick to the time allocated by the school.
People have other things to do
3/7/22, 8:28 AM - +233 55 373 9082: I have no problem with today's lecture but the lecturer not making time to lecture during the week!, How is that supposed to be our problem. The problem is our department and not us. They should get us permanent lecturers naw.  Make nobody come stress us oo
3/7/22, 8:28 AM - +233 23 240 3912: You saying "unless we prefer" as if that's even a logical alternative. If he doesn't have time, he should reschedule with the school. It's not our job to make time for him. It's his, to make time for us
3/7/22, 8:29 AM - +233 55 105 2663: We’ll agree on conditions
3/7/22, 8:29 AM - +233 57 043 8993: Baby calm down

3/7/22, 8:30 AM - +233 55 105 2663: 1. He makes no one get a grade below B+
3/7/22, 8:31 AM - +233 55 105 2663: Okay you are excluded
3/7/22, 8:32 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Unless you send your terms and conditions to him personally oo. He's not in the group🌚

3/7/22, 8:35 AM - +233 23 240 3912: I fully disagree with the weekend lecture. I'm just saying I'd turn up even after the rant. Wouldn't want to mislead anyone
3/7/22, 8:35 AM - +233 20 010 1379: Exactly it's the department not us
3/7/22, 8:36 AM - +233 24 779 7704: Please Enoch, try and make sure you don't fix any weekend time with any lecturer without our consent. We've d time table n there's no for weekends. The lecture needs to come meet us n we agree on a particular time. We're adults and can be part of decision making.
3/7/22, 8:36 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Please I'm not Enoch oo
3/7/22, 8:37 AM - +233 23 240 3912: @233200101379 <---this is him
3/7/22, 8:37 AM - +233 55 373 9082: Adult is the underlined word.
3/7/22, 8:37 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Also, I agree
3/7/22, 8:37 AM - +233 57 043 8993: You know say some lecturers dey inspect level 400’s notes??
It’s funny but yeah it’s happening 

So Im sorry but I don’t think they see us as adults
3/7/22, 8:38 AM - +233 23 240 3912: My phone isn't displaying the underline😪
3/7/22, 8:38 AM - +233 23 240 3912: 😂ah, serious?
3/7/22, 8:40 AM - +233 24 779 7704: We should behave as such. The kind of hell they put us in sometimes  can be rejected. The rules of the school is not strange to anyone of us. No Lecturer has that power to be doing what he or she wants
3/7/22, 8:40 AM - +233 20 010 1379: We all have his contact from level 200, DATABASE 2, feel free to negotiate with him if you think am not working with our interests at heart, and stop bugging me please,  am not replying all thus in my dm over the issue
3/7/22, 8:42 AM - +233 24 779 7704: We cannot negotiate with him, just tell him your people say they can't make it on weekends. Case closed
3/7/22, 8:42 AM - +233 23 946 5352: If you say that it’s like you have a problem with some of us 
No one is saying you ain’t working with our interest at heart 
What we all saying at least he should try make it on the weekdays
3/7/22, 8:42 AM - Lucas: *Kwasi Arthur* pm me ASAP
3/7/22, 8:43 AM - +233 20 010 1379: Ma guy what do you think I have been doing all this time,  I already set the class to Monday's, 

I dont even know what we are complaining about now
3/7/22, 8:44 AM - +233 24 506 5954: Eeei, like I no come online today, thinking e be holiday?
3/7/22, 8:45 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Uhmm today's a holiday???
3/7/22, 8:45 AM - +233 23 240 3912: We're saying today's a holiday, so there shouldn't be a class. That's what we're complaining about, respectfully
3/7/22, 8:46 AM - +233 20 010 1379: I made it known to this lecturer last week that weekends are out of the question when he presented me with two choices, @233547171211 and @233277203850 would be my witnesses
3/7/22, 8:46 AM - +233 23 240 3912: And the two choices are?
3/7/22, 8:46 AM - +233 24 779 7704: Thank you for that. I rest my case🙏🙏
3/7/22, 8:47 AM - +233 23 240 3912: I just want to know if we forfeiting holidays was part of the agreed upon deal
3/7/22, 8:48 AM - +233 20 010 1379: I know that and I stated it to the lecturer before he instead and try to shift the class to Sunday again, then we reach a consensus that he comes today and we meet for a short time and plan it out us a class
3/7/22, 8:49 AM - +233 20 010 1379: Sunday or Monday
3/7/22, 8:50 AM - +233 26 771 1135: 😂

3/7/22, 9:17 AM - +233 24 676 6564: @233200101379 why didn't you inform us earlier that we will be having lecture today?
Am not even on campus.
You should have let us know the choices he presented to you as a group.
It's one thing to take decisions on our behalf and another thing to let us know the decision you have taken.

Good morning guys, it's unfortunate but I bring news of sorrow and sadness, I would like us to share this moment of loss and grief of our brother Manuel mostly known as Palago as he grieves. Behind his smiles was the pain of loosing his Dad last year and just this year also loosing his Mom on his birthday as some of you may know, he's the eldest son of his family and as such the responsibilities of the funeral rest on him. In short I would like us all to lend a helping hand to him, let's send our condolences in words of love and financial support to him as he puts his Mom to rest this Saturday.

Please do send your support to 0200101379, name on the acc is Enoch Sem.

Hello guys.
Do you want to attend the Sunday classes, because I have already spoken to Mr. Elliot about it and he says if it doesn't favour us we can just say no.

On this note are we all in agreement that we don't want Sunday classes??
3/11/22, 7:44 PM - +233 55 877 0980: yes please daddy

3/11/22, 7:46 PM - +233 24 506 5954: No Sunday lecture

But did Mr Elliott tell you the alternative if the man can't make it on week days?

Hello guys.
Personally I can't stomach the idea of Sunday class.
If we can all agree no problem, am going to inform the lecturer that I won't be able to make it to the Sunday class, you can also do same.

I was told he gave another assignment last week and asked that I gather all the assignments. I will drop a link shortly for the submission of the assignments.

3/23/22, 1:01 PM - +233 55 136 8074: WARNING*
*Mobile Money*
The new technique of scammers called *JUMPED*

The scammer makes you a *real deposit* with his number, it's not a *fake deposit*, he really sends you money "a small sum like 20gh or 30gh..." so you tell yourself that It is obviously a deposit.
However, the problem is that as soon as he makes the deposit, right after he launches a *withdrawal on your number*.
So you will certainly be animated by the joy of having received a deposit, check your balance. And for lack of vigilance, you validate his withdrawal request on your account and your account is automatically emptied or half empty.
We just lure you with 20gh or more and we ruin you.

*To defeat this system*, each time you have received a *deposit*, to check your balance, type a *wrong code*, this will cancel all withdrawal requests, then check your balance with your *real code* , this reflex we must have it to avoid being fooled by these * thugs *.

This is therefore the place for us to share this message with all our contacts in order to be careful because this *new technique* risks doing damage.

*Shared as received*

I encourage @233200101379 setup or maintain a telegram channel.

The main WhatsApp group is messy, if you loose the document/file you're unable to re-download after a certain period.
3/31/22, 8:53 AM - +233 57 043 8993: Hmm
3/31/22, 8:55 AM - Ralph: Eii ok
3/31/22, 8:58 AM - +233 20 010 1379: Create one and put the stuff there and manage it wai, I believe I said this during level 100 when you kept raising the issue
3/31/22, 9:00 AM - +233 23 310 0394: You never critic well at all

3/31/22, 9:05 AM - +233 23 310 0394: I don't recall the reason you gave as to why we can't use say Telegram
3/31/22, 9:08 AM - +233 23 310 0394: If it's an issue as you say, find a solution. There are numerous.

Remember, *we're problem solvers.*
3/31/22, 9:12 AM - +233 57 043 8993: Oh big bro said he posted it here
3/31/22, 9:16 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Created a group, it was never utilized 🤷🏽‍♂️
Files can easily be tagged over there. Not sure why we didn't move to telegram either
3/31/22, 9:18 AM - +233 23 310 0394: Just for course material mpo is fine


The regular Ghanaian fears change😂

Have you realized how difficult it is to get material for departmental courses
It's because those who've gone before us didn't think of an ingenious way to make accesible those resources for us.

And here we are doing the same old, tsw😂
3/31/22, 9:19 AM - +233 23 310 0394: He's typing...

I believe nothing is stopping you from doing that.


Now please let me concentrate, thank you.

You’ve said enough 😒
3/31/22, 9:35 AM - +233 20 304 3177: Yho not fair
3/31/22, 9:36 AM - +233 20 010 1379: Well noted.
3/31/22, 9:36 AM - +233 23 310 0394: Well, his response isn't satisfactory.

On the record, I haven't disrecpected him. That's his style of leadership - hands off
3/31/22, 9:37 AM - Liva: You’re crossing boundaries that’s what I’m drawing your attention to

3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 23 946 5352: Make you all cut this crap

It was just slides someone asked 
If it tagged none of this would happen
Sometimes you people have what someone might be asking but you just keep mute and keep it to your selves
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 26 771 1135: I think we should make Mario the course rep for a couple weeks
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 26 771 1135: So that he steers things in the right direction
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 55 373 9082: Masa respect yourself wai
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Since he knows better. Let’s give him the chance
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Ah
3/31/22, 9:38 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Plenty talk saa
3/31/22, 9:39 AM - +233 50 338 6175: 😂😂😂😂
3/31/22, 9:39 AM - +233 55 105 2663: No one should warn anybody here

3/31/22, 9:40 AM - +233 23 240 3912: "Another one"
-DJ Khaled, circa 1420
3/31/22, 9:40 AM - +233 57 043 8993: Hmmm
3/31/22, 9:40 AM - +233 23 310 0394: Hmm not that
Most of us are complaining we don't have access to material.

You know how messy WhatsApp can get, at times we forget to download em & after a couple of weeks you're unable to access em.
Instead of him to give me a better response he chooses vawulence.

He's always been on me when I offer some helpful suggestions
3/31/22, 9:40 AM - +233 55 373 9082: All jokes aside, the young man really try give we all. If you can't see it, better zip your proboscis
3/31/22, 9:41 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Anyway, Mario, you can create a telegram group though. Nothing and nobody is stopping you. When Enoch shared the slides here, you can forward them there so you can access them anytime you want. Simple. It ain’t that hard
3/31/22, 9:41 AM - +233 23 240 3912: Kendrick Lamar, 2017
3/31/22, 9:41 AM - +233 23 240 3912: You could've suggested without being hostile, you know?
3/31/22, 9:41 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Enoch tries so much. He’s done his best for years. And he’s done a fairly good job
3/31/22, 9:42 AM - +233 26 771 1135: Ah😂😂

3/31/22, 9:43 AM - +233 20 304 3177: You seem hypocritical to me  since you critices everything you think is wrong yet not doing anything to remedy them
3/31/22, 9:44 AM - +233 23 310 0394: Some decisions I can't take em cos the class won't rally behind me

So if I have suggestions I forward to the reps to look at em hoping they adopt some to remedy our plight
3/31/22, 9:44 AM - +233 26 771 1135: I’m not saying your suggestions ain’t helpful. No suggestion is wrong. But the question is- how feasible is it for him, and for us all? Sometimes, you gotta put yourself in his shoes. Personally, I hardly pay attention to texts on WhatsApp but when I need slides to read, I search for it.

3/31/22, 9:47 AM - +233 24 676 6564: Mario be careful cuz those who shout hosanna will soon shout crucify him!! 🤣🤣🤣
3/31/22, 9:48 AM - +233 57 043 8993: So it means you can’t ask in the group since someone might have it?
And it will save you the stress of searching?
We all pay attention to the group but sometimes you come and there’s a lot of message here and you can’t read everything 
And sometimes not find what you want?
So asking too should not be a bad thing
Some of us here are selfish simple
3/31/22, 9:48 AM - +233 26 771 1135: You be my boy, you know. But if I was the course rep, I wouldn’t have engaged you from the start😂
3/31/22, 9:48 AM - +233 23 240 3912: True, it could be made easier though.
Telegram makes it easier, I created the group there as my contribution to that goal. I wasn't uploading any files to the page because there were some I didn't have access to. It'd be easier for course reps to upload it there as they get it
3/31/22, 9:48 AM - +233 26 771 1135: From the onset, I would’ve gone ghost
3/31/22, 9:48 AM - Ralph: <Media omitted>

3/31/22, 9:49 AM - +233 54 216 4852: ✊🏾
3/31/22, 9:49 AM - +233 26 771 1135: The selfish people dey. We all know that😂
But the way our man asked with plenty unnecessary remarks attached wasn’t right. You feel me?
3/31/22, 9:50 AM - +233 23 310 0394: The conclusion tho, the least said the better
3/31/22, 9:50 AM - +233 54 216 4852: Ma boy you are saying the right thing!!

3/31/22, 9:52 AM - +233 23 240 3912: It's kind of the responsibility of the course rep to make acquisition of course materials accessible for us, so yeah, someone could volunteer but it doesn't have to get to that, you barb?
3/31/22, 9:53 AM - +233 50 109 3481: As heat dey make I advertise my stickers.🐒
