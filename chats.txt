3/14/20, 9:52 PM - Mina: Yh
3/14/20, 9:53 PM - Success: Good
3/14/20, 9:55 PM - Mina: For the strawman fallacy, when. The argument is raised , the arguer takes only a portion of the argument and centers on it . When it's a broader topic. But the red herring no.  The arguer totally digresses from the topic.
3/14/20, 9:55 PM - Mina: Example
3/14/20, 9:56 PM - Mina: Kennedy agyapong who is not an economist will meet economists on a show and when. They are talking about how the country's cedi is depreciating, Kennedy talks about the roads that have been built and the free education because that's what he has knowledge about and can talk about even though it's not related to the topic
3/14/20, 9:57 PM - Mina: It's called fallacy of digression
3/14/20, 9:57 PM - Mina: That's the red herring
3/14/20, 9:58 PM - Success: Good good🤝🤝

3/14/20, 10:07 PM - Mina: 😂😂mennim oo
3/14/20, 10:07 PM - Mina: 😜
3/14/20, 10:08 PM - Mina: Okay for the hasty generalisation. It's when only a small portion of a whole is used to make a conclusion.
3/14/20, 10:10 PM - Mina: Example. Nana is good at maths and Nana is an Ashanti therefore all Ashantis are good at maths.  Nana's performance alone cannot be used to determine the performance of all Ashantis
3/14/20, 10:13 PM - Mina: And for the misplaced vividness, is when it can easily be told whether the conclusion is true or false.
3/14/20, 10:13 PM - Mina: Example

5/1/20, 5:50 AM - Mina: In the quest of(parasites) organisms which live in or on the body of other organisms, obtain nourishment and finally cause harm to the second organisms(hosts), they face certain challenges . These challenges are considered the inhibitors of the expressionof the full potential of parasites.  Given that parasites interact at close range with the hosts, hosts deploy mechanisms such as immune suppression or attacks or behaviorally choosing a site to live or being active at certain times of the day and season to avoid parasites. Both the parasitesand hosts play rital roles in their environment to ensure their continuous survival. Let elaborate four challenges parasites face in their quest to inhabit a biotic environment. First suppression or attacks by the host's immune system, then difficulty in obtaining the required nourishment due to less developed digestive system, inability of parasites to complete their their life cycle and variation in matching of host and parasite genomes.  


Most living species are parasitic. Hosts in turn deploy their immune systems to prevent infections or keep the parasites in check . The immune systemis one of the most complex systems and shows many signs of coevolution with parasites . The immune system is well tuned to it's task , as long lived multicellular organisms would probably not be able to survive and outpace their short-lived and numerous parasites. Nonetheless, immune responses vary among host's life cycle or infection by different parasite types. For instance, a host may be killed before the full potential of transmission will be exploited.

Again, most parasites due to their less elaborate digestive systems, lack adequate nourishment from the host organism. This food aquisition is by permeable tegument for active absorption and possesses muscular pharynx. These parasites due to this, depend on predigested food from host. Where in the absence of host nutrition, parasites cannot obtain nourishment from other sources. 

Parasites are faced with the challenge of variationin host and parasite genomes. In that only some parasite genotypes are able to infect a particular host genotype, and vice versa,only some host genotypes are able to resist a particular set of parasite genotypes. This means that not all parasites can infect all hosts and not all hosts can resist all parasites. Some hosts have mechanisms to counter the effect of some parasites and some parasites have mechanisms to outpace the resistance of hosts.

Finally, inability of parasites to complete their life cycle due to the heteroxenous nature of development affects their continuous survival. Some parasites require more than one host to complete it's lifecycle, hence if the host is killed whilst containing the parasites, then the life cycle will not be complete since it requires a definitive host to complete it's life cycle. For example, the life cycle of taenia solium begins from an infected human, to pigs to pig's intestinesand then back to humans. Here if the pig gets killed the parasite wouldn't achieve it's full potential on the host by it's inability to complete it's life cycle.

5/2/20, 10:29 PM - Mina: Anaa it's because he sent it on watsapp

5/2/20, 10:30 PM - Success: Here koraa deir its bad
5/2/20, 10:31 PM - Mina: Hmm
5/2/20, 10:31 PM - Mina: So what do you think
5/2/20, 10:32 PM - Success: The price range i hv seen nw is too high
5/2/20, 10:32 PM - Success: 1000 n above
5/2/20, 10:33 PM - Mina: Ah is it only one product uve seen
5/2/20, 10:33 PM - Success: Naa
5/2/20, 10:33 PM - Success: Anaa i aint seeing it well
5/2/20, 10:33 PM - Success: Its blurry
5/2/20, 10:34 PM - Mina: Which ones are you looking at for now
5/2/20, 10:34 PM - Success: The watches
5/2/20, 10:34 PM - Mina: Yh. Those are gold and diamond watches
5/2/20, 10:35 PM - Mina: Nti deyll be expensive
5/2/20, 10:35 PM - Mina: Okay lemme tell you what I think
5/2/20, 10:35 PM - Success: Listening.....
5/2/20, 10:36 PM - Mina: At first I was considering the watches cos personally, I won't like to use those products products no.
5/2/20, 10:37 PM - Mina: I was considering the watches because something like gold and diamond do not devalue
5/2/20, 10:37 PM - Mina: Their value always increase
5/2/20, 10:38 PM - Mina: But on a second thought, the price . And next, how much gold value would be contained therein
5/2/20, 10:38 PM - Mina: Maybe we'll buy it 5000, then the value is just 500
5/2/20, 10:40 PM - Mina: I was considering that again because even if anything happens to the business, we can sell the watch or something and realise a good amount than to buy a product we may not use or need
5/2/20, 10:41 PM - Mina: Now if we consider our level of commitment and "urgency",  we can decide what to buy
5/2/20, 10:44 PM - Mina: I'm also suggesting that we start the bizz together in the mean time. Why because
1. I think it'll be faster to raise the money together than individually
2. It'll be better or faster to work together than to work individually
3. We may decide to do it separately and we can both get stuck on the way and both loose. 
4. After we have moved forward together, we can always register and build another wing .
5/2/20, 10:44 PM - Mina: I think I'll pause here for you to present your ideas too
5/2/20, 10:45 PM - Success: Yh u hv raised vital points
5/2/20, 10:46 PM - Success: I am in for the ideas
5/2/20, 10:47 PM - Success: U mean we should collaborate and buy one watch?
5/2/20, 10:48 PM - Success: And how we will know the value of the diamond or gold in the watches no
5/2/20, 10:48 PM - Success: Hw will we know
5/2/20, 10:49 PM - Mina: That's why I said this
5/2/20, 10:49 PM - Success: Sekof most internet product looks good in on the net but doesnt live up to the standard
5/2/20, 10:49 PM - Mina: And I made mention of the disadvantage of we not being able to know it's worth
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Mina: And there's money involved too
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Success: So we should go in blind?
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Success: Or
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Mina: So if we think we should forgo and buy the product ithink it'll be quite easy
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Success: Yh 1000 dollars is like ghc5500
5/2/20, 10:50 PM - Mina: Not ever .
5/2/20, 10:51 PM - Mina: Im not a blind girl
5/2/20, 10:51 PM - Mina: Lol
5/2/20, 10:51 PM - Mina: What I'm trying to say is that since I'm not taking the decision alone I can't say that lets buy this or not
5/2/20, 10:52 PM - Mina: That's why I've told you what I think
5/2/20, 10:53 PM - Mina: But personally I think we should just buy a product. We can risk that one.  Than to risk a lot more
5/2/20, 10:53 PM - Success: For me the money involved with the watches are too high for us
5/2/20, 10:53 PM - Success: ...and more over we are just starting
5/2/20, 10:53 PM - Success: We can really tell what really entails
5/2/20, 10:53 PM - Success: Exactly
5/2/20, 10:54 PM - Success: We r just entering

First of all.  You're not a Muslim and herself and the rest of the relatives would never agree and I know it.  .
She has seen people who convert and don't take the religion seriously and the marriage falls in tatters 
I should consider the fact that all your people are Christian's. Would they agree either?
