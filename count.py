    text = """CHANGES TO THIS EDITION For this edition, we have strengthened the pedagogical apparatus and increased 
    the depth of coverage in selected areas all in accordance with contemporary thoughts about how best to teach 
    general chemistry. We have also made a number of smaller organizational changes to improve the flow of information. 
    The following summarizes the major improvements made throughout the book.
    Logical approach to solving problems. All worked examples are presented consistently throughout the text by 
    using a tripartite structure of Analyze-Solve-Assess. This presentation not only encourages students to use a logical 
    approach in solving problems but also provides them with a way to start when they are trying to solve a problem that 
    may seem, at first, impossibly difficult. The approach is used implicitly by those who have had plenty of practice 
    solving problems; but for those who are just starting out, the Analyze-Solve-Assess structure will serve to remind 
    students to (1) analyze the information and plan a strategy, (2) implement the strategy, and (3) check or assess their 
    answer to ensure that it is a reasonable one. Integrative Practice Examples and End of Chapter Exercises. Users of previous
     editions have given us very positive feedback about the quality of the integrative examples at the end of each chapter and the variety of the end-of-chapter exercises. We have added two practice examples (Practice Example Aand Practice Example B) to every Integrative Example in the text. Rather than replace end-of-chapter exercises with new exercises, we have opted in most chapters to increase the number of exercises. In most chapters, at least 10 new exercises have been added; and in many chapters, 20 or more exercises have been added. Use of IUPAC recommendations. We are pleased that our book serves the needs of instructors and students around the globe. Because communication among scientists in general, and chemists in particular, is made easier when we agree to use the same terms and notations, we have decided to follow with relatively few exceptions recommendations made by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In particular, the version of the periodic table that now appears throughout the text is based on the one currently endorsed by IUPAC. The IUPAC-endorsed version places the elements lanthanum (La) and actinium (Ac) in the lanthanides and actinides series, respectively, rather than in group 3. Interestingly, almost every other chemistry book still uses the old version of the periodic table, even though the proper placement of La and Ac has been known for more than 20 years! We have also made the following important changes in specific chapters and appendices: In Chapters 1 to 6, many problems are solved by using both a stepwise approach and a conversion pathway approach. Students with no chemistry background may be intimidated by the conversion pathway approach and may prefer a stepwise approach. Those who require only a refresher will likely prefer and use the conversion pathway approach. We hope that the needs of both instructors and students will be well served by showing both approaches in the early chapters. In Chapter 6 (Gases), we have changed the definition of standard 
    temperature and pressure (STP) to conform to the IUPAC recommendations. Also, we have added discussion about the molar volumes of gases and the distribution of molecular speeds. The discussion about the distribution of molecular speeds may be used as a springboard for justifying the Arrhenius form of the rate constant in Chapter 14 Chemical Kinetics. In Chapter 8(Electrons in Atoms), we have put the material on the particlein-a box into a separate section that can be used, or excluded, at the instructor s discretion. The discussion has been expanded slightly to illustrate how wave functions are used to make probability statements for an electron in a particular state. In Chapter 10(Chemical Bonding I: Basic Concepts), we have introduced the dash-and-wedge symbolism for representing three-dimensional structures of molecules, and this symbolism is used throughout the remainder of the text. Also, we have added a new Are You Wondering? box comparing oxidation states and formal charges. Chapter 12 (Intermolecular Forces: Liquids and Solids), has been reorganized so that intermolecular forces are discussed first. Trends in the properties of liquids and solids are then discussed in terms of the intermolecular forces contributing to the attraction among the entities making up the substance. In Chapter 14 (Chemical Kinetics), we have adopted the IUPAC recommendation for defining reaction rates, which takes into account the stoichiometric coefficients of the balanced chemical equation. We have also included a new Are You Wondering? box that provides a molecular interpretation of reaction progress. In Chapter 15 (Principles of Chemical Equilibrium), we have expanded the discussion of the relationships among activities, pressure and concentrations, and also among , and . In Chapter 16 (Acids and Bases), we have used curved arrows in a manner that is consistent with their use in organic chemistry, that is, to emphasize the movement of electron pairs in acid base reactions. Also, we present an improved and modernized discussion of the connection between molecular structure and acid strength. In Chapter 20 (Electrochemistry), we have made some changes in notation that are recommended by IUPAC. Most importantly, we introduce the concept of electron number, z, and use it in place of n in the Nernst equation and other equations. Chapter 21 (Chemistry of the Main-Group Elements I: Groups 1, 2, 13, and 14); and Chapter 22 (Chemistry of the Main-Group Elements II: Groups 18, 17, 16, 15, and Hydrogen) have been updated to include discussion of interesting and important materials, such as crown ether complexes, zeolites, and graphene. In Chapter 21, we introduce the concept of charge density and use it throughout these two chapters to rationalize similarities and differences in properties of elements. We have devoted two chapters to organic chemistry. Chapter 26 (Structures of Organic Compounds) focuses on the structures, conformations, preparation, and uses of organic compounds. Chapter 27 (Reactions of Organic Compounds) focuses on a few important types of reactions and their mechanisms. In examining these reactions, emphasis is placed on concepts introduced earlier in the text, such as acid or base strength, electronegativity, and polarizability. In Appendix D, we have added the molar heat capacity for each of the substances listed in Table D.2 (Thermodynamic Properties of Substances at 298.15 K). We have also provided a new Table D.5 of Isotopic Masses and Their Abundance. existing questions, create new questions, and generate quizzes, tests, exams, or homework. TestGen also allows instructors to administer tests on a local area network, have the tests graded electronically, and have the results prepared in electronic or printed reports. PowerPoints Set 1 consists of all the figures and photos in the textbook in PowerPoint format. PowerPoints Set 2 provides lecture outlines for each chapter of the textbook. PowerPoints Set 3 provides questions for Personal Response Systems (i.e., clickers) that can be used to engage students in lectures and to obtain immediate feedback about their understanding of the concepts being presented. PowerPoints Set 4consists of the all worked Examples from the textbook in PowerPoint format.
