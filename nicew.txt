You know very well that if a lecturer is not using his or her period for a quiz, then the time should be set up by both parties. Assuming Dr EE wanted to discuss something with us at 10:30am so what would've happened? My appeal is that going forward, we don't need to allow any lecturer to dictate everything to us without considering that we're equally important parties he or she should consult first. We're in level 300 now, so let's behave as such. That fear of victimization should be stopped by now.

I believe we should pair up according to our own strengths. Remember max of 3. Deadline Friday.

In financial institutions, there is a lot of focus on emerging technologies, things like chatbots and intelligent processes. But how do AI and Machine Learning apply to the ATM space, and how can they be used to make advancements? Here at Renovite we are continuously looking at the data generated by ATMs and reflecting on what it could be used for – and how. One thing that AI is good at is determining ‘what is normal?’ and this is a key element for the operability of ATMs. Some examples of models that have been built include: The ability to predict if the rate of cash being withdrawn equals what the cash management system predicted – i.e. will the ATM run out of cash? Many things can impact this. For example, if a nearby competing ATM fails, is that generating more traffic? Is the weather an influence on this ATM? Are the smaller denomination notes available on this ATM, if not, is this causing larger withdrawal amounts? These factors, together with predicting future values, is what machine learning excels at. Should we be seeing transactions from a particular ATM? It may be communicating fine, but is there a reason the ATM isn’t being used? My favourite example of when this happens is when various creatures i.e. snakes, rodents and other none-welcoming species move in and scare away customers. The lack of transactions when transactions are expected is a key part of identifying an occurrence like this and ensuring the efficiency of the monitoring process. Another use of AI is controlling the customer experience. Because AI algorithms will tend to store sequences of data and history, this can be used for recommendation engines at the ATM. We could use this in the ATM experience to target advertising messages – ensuring the adverts which get the best results are targeted towards customers. We are also reviewing how using AI can be used to create custom experiences for every customer based on the behaviour at ATMs. In Canada, the SickKids hospital is famous for using the data from health monitors together with AI techniques to predict when children are likely to have a life-threatening event, so staff can be alerted in advance. We use ATM logs to do the same thing for ATMs, capturing this data, and predicting when intervention may be required. For example, predicting card reader failure, electronic PIN pad or any other errors in the electromechanical parts in the cash dispensing process. The examples above are just scratching the surface. Capturing and using data is just the first step, but in the age of cloud and on-demand processing power, harnessing and using the data is the first step in providing game-changing technology to continuously improve the profitability of ATM estates.

If any system gains intelligence it becomes an AI else it's not, therefore an ATM is not an AI system to any extent or else we would also say a traffic light is an AI system.

However, the problem is that as soon as he makes the deposit, right after he launches a *withdrawal on your number*. So you will certainly be animated by the joy of having received a deposit, check your balance. And for lack of vigilance, you validate his withdrawal request on your account and your account is automatically emptied or half empty. We just lure you with 20gh or more and we ruin you. *To defeat this system*, each time you have received a *deposit*, to check your balance, type a *wrong code*, this will cancel all withdrawal requests, then check your balance with your *real code* , this reflex we must have it to avoid being fooled by these * thugs *. This is therefore the place for us to share this message with all our contacts in order to be careful because this *new technique* risks doing damage. *Shared as received* ‎[23/03/2022, 1:38:22 PM] Course Rep Assist: ‎image omitted ‎[23/03/2022, 1:45:39 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: ‎image omitted ‎[23/03/2022, 1:45:46 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: ‎image omitted ‎[23/03/2022, 1:45:53 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: ‎image omitted ‎[23/03/2022, 2:17:23 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: ‎image omitted ‎[23/03/2022, 2:18:45 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: ‎image omitted [23/03/2022, 2:45:10 PM] Mario: I wasn't You could have reiterated that for all our benefit [23/03/2022, 3:57:58 PM] Course Rep Assist: Were you not the same person telling the lecturer to wait till evening for the next class right in front of me?
