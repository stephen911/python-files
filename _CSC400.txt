Mr. Oko bought a well from Alhaji Adongo, and paid in full.
The next day, Adongo came to meet Mr. Oko at his shop.

OKO: Ah, Alhaji, welcome. I hope no problem o.

ALHAJI: There is no problem, Mr. Oko. I just came to tell you that I sold you the well, but not the water inside the well. If you fetch water from the well, you will pay me.

OKO: Ah, Alhaji, I am very happy you came. In fact, I was just about to come and meet you. I don't need the water in the well, I want to use the well to store some of my goods. So, I want you to come and carry all your water from the well so that water will not spoil my goods.. If you don't carry your water by tomorrow, I will start charging you rent for using my well to store your water... 

Neighbours are still trying to revive Alhaji Adongo..😅😅😅

You know very well that if a lecturer is not using his or her period for a quiz, then the time should be set up by both parties. 
Assuming Dr EE wanted to discuss something with us at 10:30am so what would've happened?

My appeal is that going forward, we don't need to allow any lecturer to dictate everything to us without considering that we're equally important parties he or she should consult first. 

We're in level 300 now, so let's behave as such. That fear of victimization should be stopped by now.
Thank you for your endless efforts all the time.

*Hello guys, I want to suggest that looking at the voting trend, one of the candidates(Vice president position) should sacrifice his/her  aspiration to the other. If not we're going to lose all the positions.*

Elections are won if you put out right strategies.

*Those candidates should contact each other as early as possible and issues a formal statement on this platform and also call other supporters from different platforms to adhere to that decision*

Thank you

Good evening please, 
I want to take a few minutes of your time to draw your attention to something, we have been a family ever since we all came to campus and joined this group, due to my inability to express my grief I have been mute about a lot of stuff. To put it simply a few of our brothers and sisters here have lost someone very dear to them, on behalf of the class I want to apologize for not being with you during  your time of pain, we humbly extend our condolences to you all who have lost someone in the past 2 years up until now, it is with deep regret that we say we are sorry 🙏🏿. 

A brother to us has lost his Mother, and on behalf of us all I extend my condolences for your lost and ask that you stay strong.  The brother whom I speak of is Rockson, please give him some words of encouragement when you see him and let him know we are there for him as he has allowed me to make this known to the entire class, Once again stay strong🙏🏿.

❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤❤️

It costs but trust me it's worth it.
With internet to our disposal, you can practically learn anything online.

Did you know some group of people have made an open source curricula of computer science & other fields online.

I'll share that after this, back to interest look for job ads & look for the skills they require so you build on it. *The paper(cert)* opens doors but will keep you in the room is your skill which usually is done by you.

[25/09/2021, 8:58:09 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: No worries
[25/09/2021, 8:58:36 PM] Course Rep Assist: Change is happening, but it is the rate at which it's happening that's the problem
[25/09/2021, 8:58:41 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: I think the fisheries and aquatics people have no problem, might be because we're close to the sea though
[25/09/2021, 9:02:31 PM] Course Rep Assist: If you remember correctly, when we came to campus we were the first to complain about we not doing python but the physics department did, when we forwarded this to the lecturers what happened, we can all see it now that it has been added and it's been thought
[25/09/2021, 9:03:31 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: We're doing python?
[25/09/2021, 9:05:06 PM] Course Rep Assist: It takes five year to be able to change an academic policy, we might not benefit from pointing these things out but those who come before us will benefit of it,
@233269160808 if am not mistaken you made this statement way back then.😊
[25/09/2021, 9:05:14 PM] ‪+233 24 779 7704‬: Please don't defend the department. We know every department has a problem but ours is too bad.
[25/09/2021, 9:05:38 PM] Course Rep Assist: Data structures
[25/09/2021, 9:05:56 PM] Course Rep Assist: But the 100 are doing it official
[25/09/2021, 9:06:52 PM] Course Rep Assist: Please finish reading,
To what end am I defending the department, am only setting the fact on the ground straight
[25/09/2021, 9:09:19 PM] ‪+233 24 779 7704‬: It's not about adding python to our courses that matters, how it is been taught matters. 

They'll hire lecturers who cannot do the work to come and handle us at the end of the day we will benefit nothing.
[25/09/2021, 9:10:26 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: Preach bro😌
[25/09/2021, 9:13:07 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: Ah that 😂
[25/09/2021, 9:13:10 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: Okay, good for them 👌🏽
[25/09/2021, 9:14:08 PM] ‪+233 24 171 6342‬: @233554317909 is only trying to say the department is trying to make changes but the changes be slow. Probably because of a financial constraint.
We may not benefit from it much but its a start🤷🏽‍♂️
[25/09/2021, 9:20:25 PM] ‪+233 24 779 7704‬: They're certain things that can be changed without necessarily money. 
We d students need to advocate for those changes.
As for change, it will happen but there must be a push by we the beneficiaries.
[25/09/2021, 9:21:04 PM] ‪+233 24 171 6342‬: For example

[03/11/2021, 10:39:16 PM] ‪+233 24 779 7704‬: Applications open for Cardano’s  5th Haskell Course in Accra, Ghana Input-Output Global (IOG) (the engineering company behind Cardano)  one of the world's pre-eminent blockchain engineering companies, will partner with Pan-African Tech Foundation (PATF) to run this course in Accra.

Applicants interested in this course can access the application forms via https://www.p-atf.org/cardanohaskellcourse   and use the password  I3l0kCh4iN   to gain access. This course is free. The application process commenced on the 1st of November, 2021. 80 candidates will be shortlisted by 10th December. The course will commence on 10th January 2022, and it will last 9 weeks.

The course outline will include 4 weeks of training on Haskell programming language and 4 weeks of the Plutus Pioneer Program. The training structure and the training material will be developed by Dr Lars Brünjes. Dr Brünjes holds a PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Regensburg in Germany. 

The training will include smart contract programming with Plutus, a programming language developed specifically for smart contracts by IOG (Plutus Pioneer Program) and functional programming with Haskell. Functional programming is defined as the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side effects. Traditional languages like Java and Python are adopting functional programming principles as it is great for in-demand tasks such as data analysis and machine learning. 

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. It is heavily used in FinTech due to its security, transparency, and accuracy without compromising on credibility and reducing regulatory costs. This training will allow students to work on real-life programming experience and smart contract applications.

The Haskell course has been successfully run in Athens, Greece, then in Barbados in association with the University of West Indies; in Ethiopia in co-operation with the Ethiopian Ministry of Innovation and Technology, and the Ugandan Government. With the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, IOG runs an online learning course with Haskell in Mongolia.

Sorry for the short notice 
But information reaching me is that a member of the class is no longer part of the single books 
Hence our brother Richmond is tying the knot this coming Saturday 15 January at the Methodist church of Ghana (Tema assembly)
He wanted it to be a private ceremony but upon talking to him he agreed that we inform the class 
Thank you 
You can send your best wishes to him

So it's rather unfortunate to announce that the year isn't going well for some of us.I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I have no choice. A brother amongst us who goes by the name Samuel Okyere Wai recently lost his elder brother and I would like us all to support he nd his family with whatever little amount we have to support he and his family in this hard time. So if you're willing to support please do send your contribution to my momo number-0553763443 with the name Godliver Alangyam. Thank you and do have a great day😌

Truth is even if I give y’all up to the end of the year saf, most of you will still not send anything neither would the amount you plan to send change and that is the complete truth so let’s be realistic.

The more you postpone things, the more excuse people get to tell you “Oh I forgot” when actually they haven’t and they’ll just keep giving excuses till God knows when.

Please oo look at something  here oo, project work and group assignment are very different one, take a look at how Dr. Alimatu grouped us randomly and the result of such grouping, some members will be very reluctant while others do the work. I believe we should pair up according to our own strengths.

Remember max of 3.
Deadline Friday.

Note that it's only the grouping, a project supervisor will be assigned to you and give a topic for the project. 

Thank you.

Hope you’re all doing well?

So this is the little I have to say with regards to the groupings.

Truth is I have worked with y’all in one way or the other and I must say you each are unique in your own way.Don’t let laziness make you feel or think you’re not good enough for something.

If you would brush off the laziness,halt certain things or people that take up much of your time and attention, you’ll realize how unique you are.Also put aside all those perceptions you have about others not being good and what not because truth is they are but you just don’t know it yet😊

This is the little I have to say.Hope it helps you in making the right decisions 🤗

Any last addition.
Note: you can do your project alone as well.



Unlike quiz and examination, you can get assistance from others, its allowed (I can attest to that, I have been in a number of them so far), all that is required is that you understand and can defend your project that's all.

Am willing and available to provide assistance if need and am sure we can work in groups and at the same time as a class to help each other.

I will be submitting the list @ 1:20pm that's all the time I can buy for you. Thank you

A video of how ATMs work
You can watch from minute 2:14 if you just want to know about the transaction process
[01/03/2022, 3:49:40 PM] ‪+233 55 105 2663‬: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two of the buzzwords of the moment. In financial institutions, there is a lot of focus on emerging technologies, things like chatbots and intelligent processes.


But how do AI and Machine Learning apply to the ATM space, and how can they be used to make advancements?

Here at Renovite we are continuously looking at the data generated by ATMs and reflecting on what it could be used for – and how. One thing that AI is good at is determining ‘what is normal?’ and this is a key element for the operability of ATMs.

Some examples of models that have been built include:


The ability to predict if the rate of cash being withdrawn equals what the cash management system predicted – i.e. will the ATM run out of cash? Many things can impact this. For example, if a nearby competing ATM fails, is that generating more traffic? Is the weather an influence on this ATM? Are the smaller denomination notes available on this ATM, if not, is this causing larger withdrawal amounts? These factors, together with predicting future values, is what machine learning excels at.
 
Should we be seeing transactions from a particular ATM? It may be communicating fine, but is there a reason the ATM isn’t being used? My favourite example of when this happens is when various creatures i.e. snakes, rodents and other none-welcoming species move in and scare away customers. The lack of transactions when transactions are expected is a key part of identifying an occurrence like this and ensuring the efficiency of the monitoring process.
 
Another use of AI is controlling the customer experience. Because AI algorithms will tend to store sequences of data and history, this can be used for recommendation engines at the ATM. We could use this in the ATM experience to target advertising messages – ensuring the adverts which get the best results are targeted towards customers. We are also reviewing how using AI can be used to create custom experiences for every customer based on the behaviour at ATMs.
 
In Canada, the SickKids hospital is famous for using the data from health monitors together with AI techniques to predict when children are likely to have a life-threatening event, so staff can be alerted in advance. We use ATM logs to do the same thing for ATMs, capturing this data, and predicting when intervention may be required. For example, predicting card reader failure, electronic PIN pad or any other errors in the electromechanical parts in the cash dispensing process.
The examples above are just scratching the surface. Capturing and using data is just the first step, but in the age of cloud and on-demand processing power, harnessing and using the data is the first step in providing game-changing technology to continuously improve the profitability of ATM estates.

[01/03/2022, 3:52:15 PM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: This talks of how AI "can" be used in ATM. Thus making it an AI automation
[01/03/2022, 4:00:51 PM] ‪+233 55 105 2663‬: Please, what is the current state of Russia?

[01/03/2022, 4:04:58 PM] Course Rep Assist: The key word you @233540389039  are missing is intelligence. If any system gains intelligence it becomes an AI else it's not, therefore an ATM is not an AI system to any extent or else we would also say a traffic light is an AI system.

Good morning guys, it's unfortunate but I bring news of sorrow and sadness, I would like us to share this moment of loss and grief of our brother Manuel mostly known as Palago as he grieves. Behind his smiles was the pain of loosing his Dad last year and just this year also loosing his Mom on his birthday as some of you may know, he's the eldest son of his family and as such the responsibilities of the funeral rest on him. In short I would like us all to lend a helping hand to him, let's send our condolences in words of love and financial support to him as he puts his Mom to rest this Saturday.

Please do send your support to 0200101379, name on the acc is Enoch Sem.

Hello guys.
Do you want to attend the Sunday classes, because I have already spoken to Mr. Elliot about it and he says if it doesn't favour us we can just say no.

On this note are we all in agreement that we don't want Sunday classes??
[11/03/2022, 7:44:04 PM] Gaze: yes please daddy

Hello guys.
Personally I can't stomach the idea of Sunday class.
If we can all agree no problem, am going to inform the lecturer that I won't be able to make it to the Sunday class, you can also do same.

[23/03/2022, 1:01:08 PM] ‪+233 55 136 8074‬: WARNING*
*Mobile Money*
The new technique of scammers called *JUMPED*

The scammer makes you a *real deposit* with his number, it's not a *fake deposit*, he really sends you money "a small sum like 20gh or 30gh..." so you tell yourself that It is obviously a deposit.
However, the problem is that as soon as he makes the deposit, right after he launches a *withdrawal on your number*.
So you will certainly be animated by the joy of having received a deposit, check your balance. And for lack of vigilance, you validate his withdrawal request on your account and your account is automatically emptied or half empty.
We just lure you with 20gh or more and we ruin you.

*To defeat this system*, each time you have received a *deposit*, to check your balance, type a *wrong code*, this will cancel all withdrawal requests, then check your balance with your *real code* , this reflex we must have it to avoid being fooled by these * thugs *.

This is therefore the place for us to share this message with all our contacts in order to be careful because this *new technique* risks doing damage.

*Shared as received*

Files can easily be tagged over there. Not sure why we didn't move to telegram either
[31/03/2022, 9:17:58 AM] Mario: Just for course material mpo is fine


The regular Ghanaian fears change😂

Have you realized how difficult it is to get material for departmental courses
It's because those who've gone before us didn't think of an ingenious way to make accesible those resources for us.

And here we are doing the same old, tsw😂

Most of us are complaining we don't have access to material.

You know how messy WhatsApp can get, at times we forget to download em & after a couple of weeks you're unable to access em.
Instead of him to give me a better response he chooses vawulence.

He's always been on me when I offer some helpful suggestions

[31/03/2022, 9:41:11 AM] ‪+233 26 771 1135‬: Anyway, Mario, you can create a telegram group though. Nothing and nobody is stopping you. When Enoch shared the slides here, you can forward them there so you can access them anytime you want. Simple. It ain’t that hard

[31/03/2022, 9:44:44 AM] Mario: Some decisions I can't take em cos the class won't rally behind me

So if I have suggestions I forward to the reps to look at em hoping they adopt some to remedy our plight
[31/03/2022, 9:44:50 AM] ‪+233 26 771 1135‬: I’m not saying your suggestions ain’t helpful. No suggestion is wrong. But the question is- how feasible is it for him, and for us all? Sometimes, you gotta put yourself in his shoes. Personally, I hardly pay attention to texts on WhatsApp but when I need slides to read, I search for it. I go through the page, looking for what I want… except that particular file is not on the page
[31/03/2022, 9:45:00 AM] Kofi Emma: It seems almost everyone is against mario..so im supporting him for everything to be balance ✊🏾..Go mario

[31/03/2022, 9:47:58 AM] ‪+233 57 043 8993‬: So it means you can’t ask in the group since someone might have it?
And it will save you the stress of searching?
We all pay attention to the group but sometimes you come and there’s a lot of message here and you can’t read everything 
And sometimes not find what you want?
So asking too should not be a bad thing
Some of us here are selfish simple
[31/03/2022, 9:48:16 AM] ‪+233 26 771 1135‬: You be my boy, you know. But if I was the course rep, I wouldn’t have engaged you from the start😂
[31/03/2022, 9:48:20 AM] ‪+233 23 240 3912‬: True, it could be made easier though.
Telegram makes it easier, I created the group there as my contribution to that goal. I wasn't uploading any files to the page because there were some I didn't have access to. It'd be easier for course reps to upload it there as they get it
[31/03/2022, 9:48:29 AM] ‪+233 26 771 1135‬: From the onset, I would’ve gone ghost

But the way our man asked with plenty unnecessary remarks attached wasn’t right. You feel me?
